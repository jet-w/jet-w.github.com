Learning diagnosis aims to promote students’ learning according to diagnostic results which typically including diagnostic feedback and interventions. However, most existing cross-sectional learning diagnoses are not concerned about measuring growth in learning. By contrast, longitudinal learning diagnosis evaluates students’ knowledge and skills (collectively known as latent attributes) and identifies their strengths and weaknesses over a period (Zhan, 2020b).\",\"Key Information\",\"The functions of longitudinal learning diagnosis\",\"evaluates students’ knowledge and skills\",\"identifies their strengths and weaknesses\",\"A complete longitudinal learning diagnosis should include at least two parts: an instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis of specific content and a longitudinal learning diagnosis model (LDM). The precondition of the measurement of longitudinal learning is a high-quality instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis. The data collected from the instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis can provide researchers with opportunities to develop longitudinal LDMs that can be used to track individual growth over time. Additionally, in recent years, several longitudinal LDMs have been proposed, for review, see Zhan (2020a). Although the usefulness of these longitudinal LDMs in analyzing longitudinal learning diagnosis data has been evaluated through some simulation studies and a few applications, the development process of an instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis is rarely mentioned (cf. Wang et al., 2020). The lack of an operable development process of instrument hinders the application and promotion of longitudinal learning diagnosis in practice and prevents practitioners from specific fields to apply this approach to track individual growth in specific domains.\",\"Key Information\",\"Parts of a complete longitudinal learning diagnosis\",\"an instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis of specific content\",\"a longitudinal learning diagnosis model (LDM)\",\"Currently, there are many applications use cross-sectional LDMs to diagnose individuals’ learning status in the field of mathematics because the structure of mathematical attributes is relative clear to be identified, such as fraction calculations(Tatsuoka, 1983; Wu, 2019), linear algebraic equations(Birenbaum et al., 1993), and spatial rotations(Chen et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). Some studies also apply cross-sectional LDMs to analyze data from large-scale mathematical assessments (e.g., George and Robitzsch, 2018; Park et al., 2018; Zhan et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020). However, most of these application studies use cross-sectional design and cannot track the individual growth of mathematical ability.\",\"Key Information\",\"Most of applications that using cross-sectional design cannot track the individual growth of mathematical ability.\",\"In the field of mathematics, understanding rational numbers is crucial for students’ mathematics achievement (Booth et al., 2014). Rational numbers and their operations are one of the most basic concepts of numbers and mathematical operations, respectively. The fact that many effects are put into rational number teaching makes many students and teachers struggle to understand rational numbers (Cramer et al., 2002; Mazzocco and Devlin, 2008). The content of rational number operation is the first challenge that students encounter in the field of mathematics at the beginning of junior high school. Learning rational number operation is not only the premise of the subsequent learning of mathematics in junior high school but is also an important opportunity to cultivate students’ interest and confidence in mathematics learning.\",\"The main purpose of this study is to develop an instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis, especially for the content of rational number operations.

In the analysis of previous studies, the confirmation of attributes mainly adopted the method of literature review(Henson and Douglas, 2005) and expert judgment(Buck et al., 1997; Roduta Roberts et al., 2014; Wu, 2019). This study used the combination of these two methods.\",\"Key Information\",\"Preoperation: Recognizing the core attributes involved in the field of studyPrevious Methods on confirmation of attributes:\",\"literature review\",\"expert judgment\",\"Current Methods on confirmation of attributes Combination of the previous two methods\",\"First, relevant content knowledge was extracted according to the analysis of mathematics curriculum standards, mathematics exam outlines, teaching materials and supporting books, existing provincial tests, and chapter exercises. By reviewing the literature, we find that the existing researches mainly focus on one or several parts of rational number operation. For example, fraction addition and subtraction is the most involved in existing researches (e.g., Tatsuoka, 1983; Wu, 2019). In contrast, it is not common to focus on the whole part of rational number operation in diagnostic tests. Ning et al. (2012) pointed out that rational number operation contains 15 attributes; however, such a larger number of attributes does not apply in practice.\",\"Second, according to the attribute framework based on the diagnosis of mathematics learning among students in 20 countries in the Third International Math and Science Study–Revised (Tatsuoka et al., 2004), the initial attribute framework and the corresponding attribute hierarchy (Leighton et al., 2004) of this study were determined after a discussion among six experts, including two frontline mathematics teachers who have more than 10 years’ experience in mathematics education, two graduate students majoring in mathematics, and two graduate students majoring in psychometrics (see Table 1 and Figure 2).\",\"Label\",\"Attribute\",\"Description\",\"A1\",\"Rational number\",\"Concepts and classifications\",\"A2\",\"Related concepts of the rational number\",\"Opposite number, absolute value.\",\"A3\",\"Number Axis\",\"Concept, number conversion, comparison of the size of numbers.\",\"A4\",\"Addition and subtraction of rational numbers\",\"Addition, subtraction, and addition operation rules.\",\"A5\",\"Multiplication and division of rational numbers\",\"Multiplication, involution, multiplication operation rule, division and reciprocat.

All experts agreed that the attributes and their hierarchical relationships were reasonable. In the think-aloud protocol analysis, six items were initially prepared according to the initial attribute framework and attribute hierarchy (see Table 2). Then, six seventh graders were selected according to above-average performance, gender balance, willingness to participate, and ability to express their thinking process (Gierl et al., 2008). The experimenter individually tested these students and recorded their responses; in the response process, the students were required to say aloud their problem-solving train of thought. Taking the responses of two students to item 6 as an example, Figure 3 and Table 3 present their problem-solving process and thinking process, respectively. Although different students used different problem-solving processes, they all used addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve the items of the mixed operation of rational numbers. Therefore, mastering A4 and A5 are prerequisites to mastering A6, and they validate the rationality of the attribute hierarchy proposed by experts.\",\"Table 2.

Correspondingly, the initial Q-matrix (i.e., test blueprint) (Tatsuoka, 1983) was constructed based on these 40 permissible attribute patterns and with the following factors in mind: (a) the Q-matrix contains at least one reachability matrix for completeness (Ding et al., 2010); (b) each attribute is examined at least twice, and (c) the test time is limited to a teaching period of 40 min to ensure that students have a high degree of involvement. Finally, the test length was determined as 18, including 12 multiple-choice items and 6 calculation items (see Figure 4). Notice that all items are dichotomous scored in current study.

For relative fit indices, smaller values indicate a better fit. The DINA model was preferred based on the BIC, and the GDINA model was preferred based on the AIC. According to the parsimony principle (Beck, 1943), a simpler model is preferred if its performance is not significantly worse than that of a more complex model. Both AIC and BIC introduced a penalty for model complexity. However, as the sample size was included in the penalty in BIC, the penalty in BIC was larger than that in AIC. The DINA model was chosen as the best-fitting model given the small sample size of this study, which might not meet the needs of an accurate parameter estimation of the GDINA model, and the item parameters in the DINA model having more straightforward interpretations.

First, to increase operability, only the binary attributes were adopted. As the binary attribute can only divide students into two categories (i.e., mastery and non-mastery), it may not meet the need for a multiple levels division of practical teaching objectives (Bloom et al., 1956). Polytomous attributes and the corresponding LDMs (Karelitz, 2008; Zhan et al., 2020) can be adopted in future studies. Second, the adopted instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis was based on parallel tests. However, in practice, perfect parallel tests do not exist. In further studies, the anchor-item design (e.g., Zhan et al., 2019) can be adopted to develop an instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis. Third, an appropriate Q-matrix is one of the key factors in learning diagnosis (de la Torre, 2008). However, the Q-matrix used in the instrument may not strictly meet the requirements of identification (Gu and Xu, 2019), which may affect the diagnostic classification accuracy.\"]},\"98\":{\"c\":[\"model\"]},\"99\":{\"h\":\"QMatrix 3\",\"t\":[\"This article is copy the online paper content and make some notes for better understanding.

To date, most cognitive diagnostic studies on reading tests have focused on retrofitting a single booklet from a large-scale assessment (e.g., PISA and PIRLS). Critical issues in CDA involve the scarcity of research to develop diagnostic tests and the lack of reliability and validity evidence. This study explored the development and validation of the Diagnostic Chinese Reading Comprehension Assessment (DCRCA) for primary students under the CDA framework. Reading attributes were synthesized based on a literature review, the national curriculum criteria, the results of expert panel judgments, and student think-aloud protocols. Then, the tentative attributes were used to construct three booklets of reading comprehension items for 2–6 graders at three key stages. The assessment was administered to a large population of students (N = 21,466) in grades 2–6 from 20 schools in a district of Changchun City, China. Q-matrices were compared and refined using the model-data fit and an empirical validation procedure, and five representative cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs) were compared for optimal performance. The fit indices suggested that a six-attribute structure and the G-DINA model were best fitted for the reading comprehension assessment. In addition, diagnostic reliability, construct, internal and external validity results were provided, supporting CDM classifications as reliable, accurate, and useful.

CDMs can group examinees into similar latent classes and thus can compensate for the deficiency of single outcome results generatedvia classical test theory and traditional item response theory (Ravand and Robitzsch, 2018). Due to the need for formative evaluation and instructions, CDMs have become popular in educational settings. However, Ravand and Baghaei (2020) noted that over 95% of CDM studies are methodological or simulation-oriented, approximately 4% are retrofitting, and less than 1% focus on real diagnostic test development in recent decades. Therefore, real CDM application studies have rarely found their ways into educational systems, probably because of the lack of reliability and validity evidence and thus limited confidence in the information provided by CDMs (Sessoms and Henson, 2018). There is still a wide gap between CDMs and educational practices, and true CDM studies to develop diagnostic tests from scratch are urgently needed (Alderson, 2010; Sessoms and Henson, 2018; Ravand and Baghaei, 2020).\",\"Key Information\",\"Current CDMs status\",\"Percentage\",\"CDM method\",\"95%\",\"methodological or simulation-oriented\",\"4%\",\"retrofitting\",\"less than 1%\",\"real diagnostic test development\"]},\"102\":{\"h\":\"CDA Framework\",\"t\":[\"One of the ultimate purposes of CDMs is to make inferences about what attributes an examinee has mastered using a diagnostic assessment. That is, CDA offers valuable information on the diagnostic quality of test items as well as the skill mastery patterns of test-takers, classifying those who have not mastered the item’s required skills, named non-masters, as distinct from those who have, named masters. The CDA frameworks have been proposed and optimized since Rupp and Templin (2008) published the first didactic introduction (de la Torre and Chiu, 2016; Ravand and Baghaei, 2020). In general, the construction of CDA depends on two major elements: the implicit theory section and the CDM section.\",\"Key Information\",\"Purposes of CDA: Make inferences about what attributes an examinee has mastered using a diagnostic assessment.\",\"The first step in CDA is to specify the implicit attributes that a test-taker must possess to solve an item. The generic term “attribute” is defined as posited knowledge and thinking skill(de la Torre and Douglas, 2004) or a description of the processes, subskills, and strategies that are vital for the successful execution of a particular test(Leighton et al., 2004). Once the target attributes are defined via domain experts or think-aloud protocols, individual test items can be coded at the point of item development as a Q-matrix, an incidence matrix that transforms cognitive attributes into observable item response patterns(Tatsuoka, 1990; Li, 2011). It is essential to point out that diagnostic feedback is valid only when the attribute specification is complete, the items effectively measure the targeted attributes, and the attributes are correctly specified in the Q-matrix(Ravand and Baghaei, 2020). The quality of inferences about students is unlikely to be ensured in retrofitting studies, as they commonly include items that fail to adequately tap specific cognitive characteristics(Gierl and Cui, 2008; Chen and de la Torre, 2014).\",\"Key Information\",\"CDA\",\"Step 1: Specify the implicit attributes that a test-taker must possess to solve an item.How to define attributes: defined by domain experts or think aloud protocols.what's attribute:\",\"posited knowledge and think skill or\",\"a description of the processes, subskills, and strategies that are vital for the successful execution of a particular test\",\"Step 2: individual test items can be coded at the point of item development as a Q-matrix, an incidence matrix that transforms cognitive attributes into observable item response patterns\",\"Then, CDMs are utilized to group examinees with similar skill mastery profiles, to evaluate the diagnostic capacity of items and tests and thus to reveal the degree to which they can measure the postulated attributes (Ravand and Robitzsch, 2018). CDMs make various assumptions to reveal the innate structure of a given ability by estimating the interactions among attributes (Leighton and Gierl, 2007). That is, representative CDMs can mainly be classified into three types: compensatory, non-compensatory, and general models. In compensatory CDMs, mastering one or more targeted attributes can compensate for other attributes that are not mastered. The deterministic input noisy-or-gate model (DINO; Templin and Henson, 2006) and the additive CDM (A-CDM; de la Torre, 2011) are the most representative compensatory CDMs. In contrast, if an attribute has not been mastered, the probability of a correct response in the non-compensatory CDM would be low, as other mastered attributes cannot fully compensate for it. Representative non-compensatory CDMs include the deterministic input noisy-and-gate model (DINA; Haertel, 1989) and the reduced reparameterized unified model (R-RUM; Hartz, 2002). General CDMs allow the estimation of both compensatory and non-compensatory interactions among attributes within the same test, which has influentially led to the unification of various CDMs. The most famous general model is the general DINA model (G-DINA; de la Torre, 2011), which can be transformed into the abovementioned CDMs simply by setting specific constraints to zero or changing link functions.\",\"Key Information\",\"How CDMs work\",\"Group examinees with similar skill mastery profiles.\",\"Evaluate the diagnostic capacity of items and tests.\",\"Make various assumptions to reveal the innate structure of a given ability by estimating the interactions among attributes.\",\"CDMs types\",\"Types\",\"Models\",\"Description\",\"compensatory\",\"1. deterministic input noisy-or-gate model (DINO) 2. additive CDM (A-CDM)\",\"mastering one or more targeted attributes can compensate for other attributes that are not mastered\",\"non-compensatory\",\"1. deterministic input noisy-and-gate model (DINA) 2. reduced reparameterized unified model (R-RUM)\",\"if an attribute has not been mastered, the probability of a correct response in the non-compensatory CDM would be low, as other mastered attributes cannot fully compensate for it\",\"general models\",\"general DINA model (G-DINA)\",\"allow the estimation of both compensatory and non-compensatory interactions among attributes within the same test, which has influentially led to the unification of various CDMs\",\"Like other statistical models, a CDM has no value if it fits the data poorly(de La Torre and Lee, 2010). Specifically, the fitness of CDMs can be ascertained in two ways. Relative fit indices evaluate whether the fit of one model differs significantly from that of another, and the model with smaller relative fit values is judged to better fit the data (Lei and Li, 2016). According to previous research, three well-known relative fit indices are also applicable to CDM studies, including −2 log-likelihood (−2LL), Akaike’s information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC; Lei and Li, 2016). In addition, absolute fit indices examine the adequacy of a single model (Liu et al., 2017). For instance, a model can be considered a good fit only if the value of the standardized root mean square residual (SRMSR) is less than 0.05 (Maydeu-Olivares, 2013; George and Robitzsch, 2015). In addition, the max χ2, which is the mean of the χ2 test statistics of independence for all item pairs, was found to be sensitive in specifying model misfit (Chen and Thissen, 1997; Lei and Li, 2016). A significant value of p of max χ2 suggests that the model fits poorly (George and Robitzsch, 2015).\",\"Key Information\",\"How to evaluate the fit result\",\"Relative fit indices Evaluate whether the fit of one model differs significantly from that of another, and the model with smaller relative fit values is judged to better fit the data \",\"−2 log-likelihood (−2LL),\",\"Akaike’s information criterion (AIC)\",\"Bayesian information criterion (BIC)\",\"Absolute fit indices A model can be considered a good fit only if the value of the standardized root mean square residual (SRMSR) is less than 0.05.\"]},\"103\":{\"h\":\"CDM Applications in Reading Tests\",\"t\":[\"As one of the most frequently assessed skills, reading is considered a prerequisite for success in school and life (Kim and Wagner, 2015). As complex and multiple-task abilities, the innate characteristics of reading comprehension have been widely discussed (Barnes, 2015). For example, the construction-integration model regards reading as a meaning-construction process that involves interaction between both reader and text and is influenced strongly by background knowledge (Kintsch, 1991; Snow, 2002). This model characterized reading as an iterative and context-dependent process by which readers integrate information from a text (Compton and Pearson, 2016). In contrast, theorists of component models have pointed out that some important language knowledge, cognitive processes, and reading strategies make relatively independent contributions to reading comprehension (Cain et al., 2004; Cain, 2009). These models indicate that subcomponents of reading, including but not limited to vocabulary, syntax, morphology, semantics, inference, reasoning, discourse comprehension, working memory, and comprehension monitoring, are strong and persistent predictors for readers from children to adults (Aaron et al., 2008; Kim, 2017). Although many studies found that Chinese reading and English reading shared significantly in common (Mo, 1992; Chen et al., 1993), a consensus has not been reached on the number of subcomponents involved at different developmental stages. For example, Mo (1992) proposed that the structure of Chinese language reading displayed a “replacing developmental pattern.” Factor analysis results of a reading test battery suggested that 75% of the variance in grade-6 students’ reading ability was explained by six factors, including word decoding, integration and coherence, inference, memory and storage, fast reading, and transfer ability. As grades increased to the secondary and high school levels, the influences of the abovementioned factors remained important but were partly replaced by newly emerged, higher-level factors such as generalization ability, evaluation ability, and semantic inference ability.\",\"Key Information\",\"Grade 6 students:\",\"word decoding,\",\"integration and coherence,\",\"inference,\",\"memory and storage,\",\"fast reading\",\"transfer ability\",\"High School students The six factors are still important, but partly are replace with the following 3 factors.\",\"generalization ability,\",\"evaluation ability,\",\"semantic inference ability\",\"Early research on reading cognitive diagnosis tried to explore the separability of reading ability and identify whether there are relatively independent cognitive components, processes, or skills in reading ability. For example, Jang (2009) found that evidence in Markov chain Monte Carlo aggregation supported the separability of reading into 9 attributes, and most LanguEdge test items have good diagnostic and discrimination power to measure the attributes well. Then, CDMs have been applied to retrofit the data of large-scale reading assessments such as the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the Michigan English Language Assessment Battery (MELAB), and the Iranian National University Entrance Examination (e.g., Jang, 2005; Sawaki et al., 2009; Li, 2011; Chen and de la Torre, 2014; Chen and Chen, 2016; Ravand, 2016; Ravand and Robitzsch, 2018; Javidanmehr and Sarab, 2019; George and Robitzsch, 2021; Toprak-Yildiz, 2021). Many studies have used one preset CDM for reading tests, including DINA (George and Robitzsch, 2021), Fusion (Jang, 2009; Li, 2011), LCDM (Toprak and Cakir, 2021), or G-DINA (Ravand, 2016) models. Only a few compared multiple CDMs and found that general models, such as G-DINA or LCDM, had better fits for reading assessment data(Chen and Chen, 2016; Li et al., 2016; Ravand and Robitzsch, 2018; Javidanmehr and Sarab, 2019). In some cases, compensatory models such as A-CDM or LLM have shown a relatively close fit to those of general models (Li et al., 2016; Chen and de la Torre, 2014). Therefore, researchers called for further comparison of general and reduced CDMs for optimal performance and for an understanding of the interaction mechanism among reading attributes.\",\"In the context of real CDA applications in reading assessment, research is relatively scarce. One notable effort was conducted by Xie (2014), in which a reading comprehension assessment of modern Chinese prose for junior high school students was developed and validated. Fusion model results revealed an unstructured attribute hierarchy of Chinese reading, which was composed of word decoding, formal schema, information extraction, information deduced, content analysis, content generalization, and text evaluation. In addition, Toprak and Cakir (2021) examined the second language reading comprehension ability of Turkish adults with a cognitive diagnostic reading test using the CDA framework.\",\"We collected a total of 15 relevant empirical reading studies in diverse age groups with various language backgrounds and summarized a list of candidate attributes (see Supplementary Table 1 for details) and CDMs for the next phases of test development and analysis. This detailed review yielded 6 commonly specified cognitive attributes, including vocabulary, syntax, retrieving information, making inferences, integration, and evaluation. Text-related attributes, such as narrative text, expository text, and discontinuous text, were also specified in studies of PIRLS and PISA. However, the abovementioned large-scale reading assessments were generally designed and developed under a unidimensional item response theory approach. CDM implementations to extract diagnostic feedback may raise severe issues with model fit, item characteristics, and diagnostic inferences for retrofitting data (Rupp and Templin, 2008; Gierl et al., 2010; Sessoms and Henson, 2018).\",\"Primary students are in the key stages of reading development, during which they need to transition from “learning to read” to “reading to learn,” and begin to encounter difficulties in new comprehension requirements (Carlson et al., 2014). The need for suitable instructions and reading materials as scaffolding is felt mostly at the primary level; therefore, assessing the extent to which the reading ability and subskills of students grow is valuable during their primary school years. However, students’ reading ability grows so much over the course of their schooling that a single-booklet testing design for all grades is beset with problems (Brennan, 2006). Multilevel booklet designs are typically adopted, of which the contents and difficulty can be purposefully differed to balance test precision and efficiency. However, to the best of our knowledge, all CDM implementations were conducted on a single reading booklet for second language learners or grade 4 students and above. Several authors (e.g., Ravand, 2016; Sessoms and Henson, 2018) have briefly noted that CDM applications might be specific to different characteristics of items or students. The construct equivalence of reading attributes and the generalizability of CDMs to other key developmental stages of reading remain unproven.\",\"To address these issues, this study had three goals: (a) to illustrate how the cognitive diagnostic assessment (CDA) framework can be applied to develop the Diagnostic Chinese Reading Comprehension Assessment (DCRCA) for primary students at various key stages, (b) to evaluate the attribute equivalence and model fit adequacy of the CDMs for different developmental stages, and (c) to validate the diagnostic inferences of the DCRCA about primary students’ reading subskills. To answer these questions, the study was mostly concerned with the construction of cognitive models of Chinese reading, the model-data fit evaluation of CDMs for three reading booklets, the validation of diagnostic psychometric properties, and the skill mastery profiles of primary students. This process can shed light on the limited CDA applications in reading test development and provide new methodologies for exploring reading skill structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reading assessment whose CDM model fitness, diagnostic reliability and validity were examined at various developmental stages.\",\"Key Information\",\"The goal of this paper\",\"to illustrate how the cognitive diagnostic assessment (CDA) framework can be applied to develop the Diagnostic Chinese Reading Comprehension Assessment (DCRCA) for primary students at various key stages,\",\"to evaluate the attribute equivalence and model fit adequacy of the CDMs for different developmental stages\",\"to validate the diagnostic inferences of the DCRCA about primary students’ reading subskills.\"]},\"104\":{\"h\":\"Materials and Methods\",\"t\":[\"The development and validation of the reading assessment followed the guidelines of the CDA framework (Ravand and Baghaei, 2020).

This detailed review yielded 6 commonly specified cognitive attributes, including retrieving information, making inferences, integration and summation, evaluation, vocabulary, and syntax, as well as three text-related attributes, including narrative text, expository text and discontinuous text.\",\"Expert panel’s judgments: As reading attributes are highly dependent on the characteristics of Chinese reading and the framework of reading education, researchers invited five experts in reading assessment or education to obtain their judgments of large-scale reading assessments and the Chinese Language Curriculum Criterion for Compulsory Education (abbreviated as the curriculum criterion). The “syntax” attribute was first excluded because the curriculum criterion does not advocate any grammar teaching or evaluation at the primary school level but emphasizes helping students comprehend naturally occurring materials in a real language environment (Ministry of Education, 2011). Vocabulary is considered as important as reading comprehension at the primary level, and therefore, this skill was excluded and evaluated by the Chinese Character Recognition Assessment in the test battery. Infrequent attributes were also discussed case by case. For example, formal schema (Xie, 2014) was excluded because it might blend text evaluation with text-type attributes. The importance of literary text (i.e., narrative text and poetry) at the primary level has been emphasized by the curriculum criterion as well as large-scale assessments, including the PIRLS and PISA. However, inconsistencies in other text types have been observed. The curriculum criterion merges expository text (extracted from PIRLS) and discontinuous text (extracted from PISA) into practical text, as they have similarities in their reading objectives and strategies (Compulsory Education Curriculum and Textbook Committee of the Ministry of Education, 2012). After discussion, all experts agreed that this inconsistency was worth further evaluation via empirical results.\",\"Student think-aloud protocols: To clarify the cognitive procedures that test-takers went through, 15 students from grades 2 to 6 were selected for think-aloud protocols. These students verbalized their thoughts when solving sample items. According to their answers and oral explanations, researchers identified clues to cognitive processes with an eye on the attributes inferred from the previous procedures. Overall, researchers specified and defined an initial set of eight attributes that might be crucial for primary school students (Table 1).\",\"Table 1. Definitions of the initial reading attributes.\"]},\"106\":{\"h\":\"Test Development\",\"t\":[\"According to the curriculum criterion, reading education can be divided into three key stages at the primary level. Key stage one is for grades 1 to 2, key stage two is for grades 3 to 4, and key stage three is for grades 5 to 6. Therefore, three booklets of reading diagnosis items were compiled for students at each key stage. An initial common Q-matrix for the three booklets was intentionally designed, as each item reflects one of the four cognitive processes of reading comprehension (α1–α4) and one text-related attribute (α5, α6a, and α6b). The genre and complexity of texts were controlled, as they were important factors in assessing reading comprehension (Collins et al., 2020). Fragments of literary texts (including fairy tales, stories, fables, narratives, novels, and children’s poems) and practical texts (including explanatory texts, simple argumentative articles, and discontinuous texts) were carefully selected and modified as item stems. A Chinese readability formula (Liu et al., 2021) was adopted to calculate the length, token types, lexical difficulty, function word ratio, and overall difficulty of each text. The average text length of the three booklets ranges from 150.60 to 278.57 characters, and the average text difficulty levels for the three booklets are 3.38, 3.69, and 4.40 (for details, please see Supplementary Table 2). Therefore, the three booklets are composed of conceptually appropriate short texts with increased complexity.\",\"The item generation procedures were as follows: mapping cognitive and text-type attributes to compile 73 draft multiple-choice items, an expert review to cross-validate the Q-matrix, and item refinement following the expert review. Then, after the first pilot using two booklets for grade 1–2 and 3–6 students (n = 378), 17 problematic items were removed according to the item discrimination index (item-total correlation <0.19), and several items were modified. Grade 1 students were excluded from further study because they could not adapt to the computer assessment procedures. The second pilot included 56 items in three booklets, and each booklet consisted of 18–20 items. Pilot data were obtained from 5,949 grade 2–6 students. Both classical test theory and a 2PL item response model analysis were conducted. Five items with unsatisfactory discrimination (item-total correlation <0.30 or IRT discrimination <0.50) and three items with moderate to large differential item functioning issues on gender (effect size >0.88) were removed. A total of 48 items were retained, and four items were modified or rearranged for facility (passing rates by grade < 0.20 or > 0.90). The four cognitive attributes were intentionally balanced in testing frequency (4 to 5 times each attribute), and the proportion of literacy and practical texts were similar in the three booklets. Therefore, as shown in the last line of Table 2, the total testing frequencies of the attributes were similar in the three final booklets, with slight differences in item order and proportions of text type.\",\"Table 2.

Students’ responses were scored dichotomously (0 = incorrect, 1 = correct) for each item. As already described, each item was intentionally constructed by experts to align with precisely one of the four processes of reading comprehension (α1–α4) and one text-related attribute (α5–α6). The total testing frequencies of the attributes were similar in the three final booklets, while the short passages in the three booklets were compiled with increased complexity.

The “CDM” package, version 7.5–15, was used for fitting CDMs (e.g., DINA, DINO, R-RUM, A-CDM, and G-DINA) based on the MMLE/EM algorithm (George et al., 2016; Robitzsch and George, 2019). The CDM package allows the estimation of rich sets of models, fit indices, and diagnostic validity with various emphases, which can help researchers find the most appropriate model.

These Q-matrices were compared based on the model-data fit of the G-DINA model and likelihood ratio test (see Table 3).\",\"Table 3. Model-data fitting results for Q-matrix validation.\",\"The SRMSR values of all Q-matrices were acceptable (below the 0.05 rule of thumb suggested by Maydeu-Olivares, 2013), while none of Q1 could be accepted based on the max χ2. The -2LL and AIC values suggested a direction of improvement from Q1 to Q2, while the fit values of Q2 and Q3 were close in all booklets. Likelihood ratio tests were adopted between the adjacent Q-matrices within each booklet. We found that (1) all Q2 and Q3 values were significantly better than Q1 values (p < 0.001); (2) the -2LL and AIC differences between Q2 and Q3 were small and unstable, as p values fluctuated around significance boundaries for booklets KS1 to KS3 (p ≈ 0.006, 1.00 and 0.049 respectively); and (3) the BIC consistently favored Q2 over Q3, as it was more compact and efficient. In summary, the fit indices showed similarities across booklets, suggesting that the attribute structure was the same across key stages. Based on the above results, we chose Q2 as a basis to finalize the item-attribute relationship.\",\"An empirical Q-matrix validation procedure was conducted on all Q2s to compare the proportion of variance accounted for (PVAF) by plausible q-vectors for a given item (de la Torre and Chiu, 2016). A given q-vector was deemed correct if it was the simplest vector with a PVAF above 0.95. The validation results suggested no modification for booklet KS2 or KS3 and generated suggested Q-vectors for items 6 and 15 in booklet KS1. This indicated a relatively high attribute-wise agreement between the provisional and data-driven Q-matrices across all booklets. After expert revisions and iterative modeling, researchers concluded that the suggested changes in the Q-matrix were consistent with what the item truly assessed. The likelihood ratio test suggested that the fit of finalized Q2 was significantly better than that of the initial Q2 and was slightly better than that of Q3 for booklet KS1.

The AIC and -2LL values for the G-DINA models were the lowest in the three booklets, followed by the A-CDM and the R-RUM models, while the values of the more parsimonious DINO and DINA models were observably worse. The BIC favored A-CDM, G-DINA, and A-CDM in booklets KS1 to KS3. Likelihood ratio tests suggested that none of the other CDMs fit as good as the G-DINA model. For the absolute fit values, the SRMSR values of all CDMs were below 0.05. However, only the G-DINA had insignificant max χ2 values in all cases, indicating a good fit to the data, while the DINO and DINA models were stably rejected by the significance of max χ2 in all cases. It is evident that the G-DINA model fits the entire assessment data reasonably better than the more parsimonious reduced models.\",\"Table 5.

Despite a lack of consensus on general guidelines for what constitutes a high or acceptable reliability (Templin and Bradshaw, 2013), these results indicated an above acceptable capacity of measuring students’ reading attributes.\",\"Table 6.

Figure 2 shows the item correct proportions for the masters versus the non-masters. The average item proportion correct difference was 0.53, and the differences in 41 out of the 48 items were greater than 0.40. This high value indicates a good fit between models and data, suggesting a strong diagnostic power of items and the DCRCA. In addition, this provided a valuable tool for finding poor items. For example, the differences of items 5 and 9 in booklet KS2 were smaller than 0.30. An in-depth examination suggested that these items were difficult; therefore, the item proportion correct for masters tended to be close to that for non-masters.\",\"Figure 2.

Among the remaining 15 classes, the latent class [111111], mastery of all the subskills, had the highest posterior probability, followed by [000000], mastery of none of the subskills. CDM revealed that other dominant latent classes were [000011] and [111100], to which 27.15% of the test-takers belong. The profile [000011] might reflect children’s knowledge and experiences in reading specific text genres in the given items, while the profile [111100] might reflect children’s skills and experiences in answering specific reading tasks. This result supported the RAND report (RAND Reading Study Group, 2002) that mastery of the first four cognitive attributes and the last two text attributes may be relatively independent sources of variance in different reading comprehension scores.\",\"Table 7.

Due to the criticism about a lack of true CDA research for educational purposes, the DCRCA was designed to meet the requirements of the Chinese curriculum criterion under the CDA framework proposed by Ravand and Baghaei (2020). Multiple steps were applied to maximize the diagnostic capacity and effectiveness of the DCRCA, including (1) gathering information about previous reading models and assessments; (2) specifying attribute lists based on the literature, student think-aloud protocols and expert review; (3) standardized test development and pilots; (4) empirical comparisons and refinements of Q-matrices and CDMs; and (5) reliability and validity analyses using the formal test data. The results indicate that the overall quality of the DCRCA is satisfactory and that the diagnostic classifications are reliable, accurate, and valid.\",\"Following multiple procedures of attribute specification, model-data fit comparison, and empirical validation, the Q-matrix construction results yielded six final reading attributes, including four cognitive attributes that are consistent with cognitive processing and previous empirical studies of reading and two text-related attributes that were synthesized from large-scale assessment frameworks and the Chinese curricular criterion. Adding text-related attributes significantly improved the model-data fits of Q-matrices, implying that pragmatic or background knowledge of different text types might be vital in successful reading. The literacy text attribute is consistent with previous research, while the practical text attribute is a newly extracted attribute in CDM studies on reading. Our attempts to combine expository text with discontinuous text attributes may reveal their similarity in reading strategies and worth further investigation. The validation of text-related attributes also improved the application value and scope of the DCRCA because these attributes come from the experiences of educators and thus might be easier to recognize and train (Perfetti et al., 2005). Besides, the six-attribute structure has been scrutinized as a theoretical framework of reading comprehension for students at different developmental stages. This result provides evidence regarding the construct of primary-level Chinese reading and the DCRCA from theoretical and empirical perspectives.\",\"The selection of the CDMs is critical in all CDA studies, as the optimal model not only caters to the diagnostic demands of the assessment but also reveals the interrelationships of attributes in the given domain. Five representative CDMs were compared, and the superiority of the G-DINA model was supported by all booklets and model-data fit. Therefore, it is safe to analyze the DCRCA with the saturated G-DINA model, which appeared to be flexible in accommodating various relationships among reading skills (Chen and Chen, 2016; Li et al., 2016; Ravand, 2016). The A-CDM model performed the closest level of fit indices to the G-DINA model. From a theoretical perspective, the A-CDM model could be a special case of the G-DINA model by only estimating the main effects of attributes, as the difference between the two models is that G-DINA allows additional estimation of interactions among latent skills (de la Torre, 2011). Therefore, given that the majority of the DCRCA items were designed to map one of the cognitive processes and one text type of reading, our findings support Stanovich’s (1980) interactive view of reading that holds both cognitive processes and text-related attributes to be crucial and interactive in successful execution of reading comprehension.\",\"In addition, our results showed that the absolute fit indices preferred neither compensatory (A-CDM and DINO) nor non-compensatory (R-RUM and DINA) types of CDM, and max χ2 rejected all the reduced models in booklet KS2. Consequently, current results are not enough to assert that the relationship of reading attributes is either compensatory or non-compensatory. This is consistent with the findings of Jang (2009), Li et al. (2016), and Javidanmehr and Sarab (2019), who also voted for the co-existence of compensatory and non-compensatory relationships among the latent reading subcomponents.\",\"The present study examined the diagnostic reliability and validity of the DCRCA. Reliability evidence is generally considered essential support for interpreting test results. The pattern accuracy and consistency index (Cui et al., 2012) suggested that the DCRCA reliably measures multiple reading attributes. Validity analyses are rarely conducted, with less than 22% of studies providing such information according to the literature review (Sessoms and Henson, 2018). Therefore, construct, internal, and external validities are provided for the Q-matrix and the DCRCA. The Q-matrix validation results suggest that the provisional Q-matrices have an approximately 95% attribute-wise agreement rate across booklets, which provides strong evidence for the construct validity of Q-matrix constructions (Deonovic et al., 2019). The internal validity evidence showed that the average proportion correct differences for each item were sufficiently large for most of the test items, indicating that these items have satisfying diagnostic capacity to differentiate masters from non-masters of reading. The mean score differences of only 4% of the items were less than 0.3, much lower than the proportion of 23% in retrofitted studies (Jang, 2009). This might be because retrofitting studies had to include many items that were weakly associated with targeted attributes. The possible presence of nondiagnostic items could lead to critical issues in the validity of measures of skill competencies, and thus, the test inferences might be limited.\",\"The present study contributes to instructional practices at the elementary school level, as the assessment can provide reliable, valid and useful diagnostic information. This is the first empirical study that attempts to provide evidence in construct invariance of diagnosing Chinese reading attributes at different primary grades. As reading assessment can function as formative assessment, such diagnostic feedback could be further utilized by teachers and educators for monitoring learning progressions, providing remedial instructions for reading courses and programs. However, some limitations are also worth enumerating. First, the present research did not examine how diagnostic feedback is perceived and utilized by students and teachers in a classroom setting. More studies are needed to reveal the influences of CDA applications. Second, as the DCRCA was not equated vertically, the attribute mastery states can be compared only within each key stage. Future studies are needed to apply appropriate longitudinal CDMs (Zhan et al., 2019) or vertical equating methods (von Davier et al., 2008) for CDA to investigate the developmental course of students’ reading attributes. Third, the present study did not include a sufficient number of items to assess attributes a6a and a6b. The Q-matrices may not be exhaustive to capture all reading comprehension and likely lead to limitations of the present study. Therefore, caution should be taken in interpreting our final results, and explorations of a more balanced Q-matrix construction are needed in the future. Last, although the results related to model fit and item parameters were fairly acceptable, future research should seek to improve the psychometric properties to make the report inferences more reliable. Therefore, the study was only a start. A deeper understanding of CDM application may be deduced by interpreting the dominant skill classes as learning states and the combination of skill classes as learning paths and learning progressions (Wu et al., 2020). Future studies are needed to help instructors design suitable learning plans with fine-grained diagnostic reports of students. In addition, more well-designed items can be generated and scaled as formative and summative assessments to satisfy expectations from the curriculum criterion. With the help of the DCRCA, teachers could design their own classroom reading materials and assessments as learning objectives that they wish students to attain.\"]},\"119\":{\"c\":[\"model\"]},\"120\":{\"h\":\"CDM\"},\"121\":{\"c\":[\"readme\"]},\"122\":{\"h\":\"Causal Prism\"},\"123\":{\"c\":[\"readme\"]},\"124\":{\"h\":\"A Visual Analytics Approach\",\"t\":[\"Information came from Srecko in Discord channel HS.resources at 1:50pm 07 July 2024.\",\"CausalPrism: A Visual Analytics Approach for Subgroup-based Causal Heterogeneity Exploration\"]},\"125\":{\"h\":\"Abstract\",\"t\":[\"In causal inference, estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTEs) from observational data is critical for understanding how different subgroups respond to treatments, with broad applications such as precision medicine and targeted advertising.

Data heterogeneity must be considered when estimating treatment effects, as the effect of the same treatment may vary across subgroups. As shown in Fig. 1, subgroups within the population responded differently to the treatment. The treatment exerts larger effects on Subgroup 1 and Subgroup 3 than Subgroup 2. Nevertheless, the high variance of Subgroup 1 indicates that individual differences (uncertainty of the outcome) exist. Discovering those subgroups with strong treatment effect and low outcome variance (hereinafter referred to as significant treatment effect) compared to the overall population is widely used in domains such as healthcare [50], marketing [56], and public administration [23]. For example, marketers want to find customer groups where advertising more effectively drives purchases. Since Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), known as the gold standard for causal inference [31], are not always feasible due to cost or ethical concerns, there is a strong need to uncover those causal subgroups from observational data effectively.\",\"Key Information\",\"The function of Causal inference: aims at conclusions about whether and to what extent treatments affect outcomes\",\"In practical applications, analyzing causal heterogeneity faces two challenges. First, it is nontrivial and challenging to identify important subgroups from a large number of subgroup candidates. Subgroups can be described by different combinations of variables, which could lead to a combinatorial explosion of candidates. Selecting optimal subgroups requires trade-offs among various targets in the objective space, such as effect strength, outcome variance, and subgroup coverage, further complicating the subgroup discovery process. Coordinating the above factors has to follow users’ analysis requirements. Nevertheless, the identification model can hardly communicate with humans due to the lack of interpretability, which causes the second challenge. The subgroups obtained by the black-box model may hardly be interpreted by or fail to support analysis tasks. Users still need to tediously analyze and compare multiple subgroups to determine which one they prefer. In addition, without a treatment effect explanation, numerical causal conclusions alone are difficult to convince users, especially in high-stakes safety and life-critical fields.\",\"Key Information\",\"Challenges for analyzing causal heterogeneity\",\"It is nontrivial and challenging to identify important subgroups from a large number of subgroup candidates.\",\"the identification model can hardly communicate with humans due to the lack of interpretability\",\"Existing work is insufficient to address these challenges. Automated heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation methods, such as causal trees [2] and causal forests [57], mainly construct hierarchical structures for individuals in datasets and identify leaf nodes in the hierarchies as subgroups. However, not all leaf nodes can reflect a significant treatment effect, leading to less useful results. Therefore, users still need to go through tedious review and analysis to find subgroups that meet their requirements. Subgroup discovery methods [6, 22, 55] can directly optimize correlation objectives but lack attention to the more complex causal effects that require statistical inference and confounding bias correction. Some researchers use visualization to assist causal analysis, but they either focus on the representation of causal graph structure [58, 66, 59, 37], manual selection of variables to divide subgroups [29], or clustering to obtain subgroups whose meaning is difficult to describe [28]. Therefore, how to support the cooperation between human intelligence and computing power in the analysis of HTE is still underexplored.\",\"In this work, we propose a visual analytics approach for subgroup-based causal heterogeneity exploration that supports users in effectively identifying optimal subgroups from observational data, comparing and ranking different subgroups, and verifying treatment effects.

Subgroups are described by interpretable rules, where the rule antecedents are conjunctions containing covariates and corresponding values, and the consequents correspond to subgroup evaluation metrics, such as effects and variances. Coverage and antecedent length are used as constraints to ensure interpretability. Due to multiple objectives and constraints, the optimal Pareto front of the subgroup is learned by a heuristic searching algorithm for user analysis. Second, we design and develop an interactive prototype system, Causal Prism, which incorporates intuitive visualizations of subgroups, evaluation metrics, and explanations of treatment effects, thereby facilitating users’ understanding, comparison, and verification of causal subgroups. Quantitative experiments, case studies, and expert interviews demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of the proposed model and system.

Conditional average treatment effect (CATE), individual average treatment effect (ITE) and causal rules comprise current HTE research. Reviews [30,68] offer in-depth analyses of causal inference.\",\"CATE evaluates treatment effects on specific subgroups of the population, given similar covariates like demographics. To optimize the heterogeneity of treatment effects, tree-based methods [2, 3, 57] are commonly employed to partition the covariate space into subspaces. For instance, Causal Tree [2] constructs the tree and estimates treatment effects in each subspace using separate data, avoiding overfitting by cross-validation. Wager et al. [57] suggested Causal Forest, combining causal tree ensemble results for more robust and smooth estimation. Root-to-leaf node routes naturally define subgroups of heterogeneous CATEs, making the tree model interpretable. However, tree-based methods may have limited performance due to greedy tree building process and does not necessarily return the “optimal” structure.\",\"ITE compares outcomes with and without treatment. Since only one outcome is visible, another must be estimated. Existing techniques are single- or multi-model-based depending on whether treatment and control groups are estimated independently. The former uses regression to fit treatment effects. For example, Hill et al. [33] employs Bayesian additive regression trees to fit the outcome surface. The latter fits the treated and control groups separately, achieving better performance for significant differences between groups’ outcomes. The base model uses off-the-shelf estimators like linear regression [12] or neural networks [38]. With well-tuned parameters, these models can accurately estimate effects but are uninterpretable.\",\"Several researchers have tried to find causal rules in data. For example, CRE [9] is a two-stage method that first produces rules using methods such as random forest or Gradient Boosting Machines, then picks robust ones using stability selection regularization. After mining association rules from data, Li et al. [46] conducted a cohort study to test whether the association rules were causal.\",\"Many methods have presented estimators that can accurately estimate HTE despite confounding biases. We leverage existing estimators but focus on finding subgroups with significant treatment effects among many candidates.

Visualizations have been used to explore and verify causality interactively, which can be divided into homogeneous and heterogeneous causality investigations.\",\"Homogeneous causality assumes that data’s causal mechanism is static and stable. Visualization helps users grasp complex causal relationships and make decisions. Graph-based visualizations [7,35,58,66] have been widely used to demonstrate causality in multi-attribute datasets, emphasizing the use of statistics to locate and manipulate improper relationships for what-if analysis. They employ advanced layout designs to highlight attribute distributions and enhance graph readability. In addition, design factors like node size [39], edge shape [8], and crowd beliefs [70] affect users’ understanding of causal relationships. Bar charts and scatter plots are also used to infer causality [40, 67, 69]. However, these approaches lack generalizability due to population variances such as demographics and environmental factors.\",\"Heterogeneous causality examines causal relationships or effects that vary over time or data subgroups. Most work examines causal structural heterogeneity. In Causal Structure Investigator [59], users can acquire data subdivisions through manual filtering and k-means clustering. Then, these subdivisions are mapped to causal graphs for detailed analysis of causal paths. Jin et al. [37] focus on subsets in event sequences. Overlapping adjacency matrices with inner and outer sections lets users easily identify the differences in causal relationships between subsets. Deng et al. [19] created causal graph bands with compass glyphs for spatio-temporal sequences to show dynamic causal relationships in period-based time windows. This helps users understand influence transmission and identify spurious causalities. DOMINO [60] applies time delays and event constraints to temporal causality analysis, facilitating hypotheses formulation and validation.\",\"Other research examines causal inference heterogeneity. The Absolute Standardized Mean Difference (ASMD) plot is used to assess covariate balance in groups after weighting and propensity score matching [25,52]. Guo et al. [28] created VAINE to enable users to find statistical phenomena like Simpson’s paradox by manually selecting clusters in covariate projections and observing their impact. Causalvis [29], a later proposal, enables the visualization of a whole causal analysis workflow. The raincloud and beeswarm plots in the Treatment Effect Explorer module let users manually pick subgroups faceted by covariates and analyze ITE distribution to examine heterogeneity.\",\"However, the present HTE visualization work involves timeconsuming manual participation to locate subgroups, and the subgroups obtained through clustering lack explicit interpretable descriptions. Therefore, we propose CausalPrism to automatically obtain rule-described subgroups with significant treatment effects through optimization and design visualizations for subgroup exploration, comparison, and treatment effect validation.\"]},\"130\":{\"h\":\"2.3 Subgroup Discovery and Visualization\",\"t\":[\"Subgroup discovery (SD) is a descriptive data mining method that finds data subgroups with intriguing patterns on certain goals, as summarized in comprehensive surveys [4, 32]. Data subgroups can be represented using description languages like attribute-value pairs and logical forms(e.g., conjunctions, inequalities, and fuzzy logic). Subgroup interestingness can be measured using binary, nominal, or numerical targets. Post-processing methods have been applied to select diverse and less redundant subgroups. Search methodologies like exhaustive and heuristic search have been used due to the large number of candidate subgroups.\",\"Using the exhaustive techniques [6,26,27,62], all possible subgroups are searched. Since viable subgroups are exponentially large, a naive exhaustive search is time-consuming. Minimum support, optimistic estimate pruning, and generalization-aware pruning can reduce the hypothesis space. SD-Map [6] is an exhaustive SD approach that uses depth-first search to produce candidates, extending the Frequent Pattern (FP) Growth-based association rule mining method. The SD-Map* [5] is extended with binary, categorical, and continuous target variables.\",\"Further studies [18, 22, 43, 55, 72] employed efficient heuristic methods. For example, DSSD [55] uses beam search, which starts with an initial solution and subsequently spreads to several candidates. Top performers are kept for the next iteration until a stopping condition is reached. SDIGA [18] is an evolutionary fuzzy rule induction method that facilitates the discovery of general rules by allowing variables to take multiple values. Subgroups can be evaluated in terms of confidence, support, and unusualness. Visualization techniques have also been proposed in order to support subgroup-level analysis tasks, such as subgroup multi-feature visualization [21, 24], model diagnosis on data subsets [14, 20, 42, 54, 71], and high-dimensional data subspace exploration [47, 64, 65]. For example, Taggle [21] employs a tabular visualization design that allows for hierarchical grouping and sorting of massive amounts of data. The icicle plot [20] and the map-based metaphor [47] provide help for comparisons between subgroups.\",\"However, most SD methods only focuse on correlations, involving just covariates and outcomes. It is unsuitable for SD in causal scenarios (treatment, covariates, and outcomes must be considered). To this end, we formulate causal SD as a constrained MOO problem that can be efficiently solved using heuristic search. A range of subgroup visualization techniques, such as multi-attribute ranking [24], are incorporated into the CausalPrism system to help users explore and compare subgroups.\"]},\"131\":{\"h\":\"3 BACKGROUND\"},\"132\":{\"h\":\"3.1 Preliminaries\",\"t\":[\"We introduce the basis of causal inference under the potential outcome (PO) framework [51] and give examples based on medical scenarios.\",\"A unit is an individual or object under study. A medical study unit may be a patient. The subscript 𝑖 denotes the 𝑖-th unit.\",\"A treatment is an intervention or exposure that subjects to a unit. A new medicine or therapy could be used as a treatment in a medical study. Let a binary 𝑇 indicate whether a unit has received a treatment. Units satisfying 𝑇 = 1 belong to the treatment group, while those 𝑇 = 0 belong to the control group.\",\"Outcomes are what would happen to units under different treatments. Each unit has two potential outcomes: factual outcome and counterfactual outcome. For instance, patient survival time is an outcome in a medical study. The potential outcome with treatment is 𝑌 (𝑇 = 1), also abbreviated as 𝑌 (1), and without treatment, it is 𝑌 (0).\",\"Covariates are background variables that affect treatment assignment and outcome. For example, patient demographic information such as age may influence medication use (treatment assignment) and blood pressure (outcome). Observational studies often control for covariates to mitigate confounding and provide more unbiased effects estimates. Covariates are represented as a vector X𝑖 = (𝑥𝑖,1, · · · , 𝑥𝑖,𝑑), where 𝑑 is the number of covariates.\",\"Observational data refers to data collected without the researcher manipulating the environment or the subjects being studied. It differs from RCTs, which randomly assign treatment to each unit. The observational data containing 𝑛 units is denoted by D = {(𝑇𝑖 ,X𝑖 ,𝑌𝑖)}𝑛 𝑖=1 .\",\"Treatment effect refers to the impact of a treatment on an outcome. It can be obtained by quantitatively comparing the potential outcomes in the treatment and control conditions at different levels, such as populations, subgroups, and units. For unit 𝑖, its individual treatment effect (ITE) is defined as: 𝜏𝑖 = 𝑌𝑖(1) −𝑌𝑖(0). (1)\",\"Unfortunately, for any unit, only one of the two potential outcomes can be observed, so ITE is not identifiable. One way to address this lack of counterfactual outcomes is to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) on the population, defined as follows: 𝜏 = E[𝑌 (1) −𝑌 (0)]. (2)\",\"ATE may fail to accurately reflect treatment effects due to the heterogeneity of units. This is overcome by conditional average treatment effect (CATE) on subgroups, which is defined as follows: 𝜏(x) = E[𝑌 (1) −𝑌 (0) | X = x]. (3)\",\"Propensity score is a balancing score 𝑒(x) = 𝑃(𝑇 = 1 | X = x), defined as the conditional probability of getting a treatment given the covariates. In observational data, a biased treatment effect would be obtained by directly using the difference between the average outcome of the treatment and control groups because the treatment assignment is correlated with covariates. Rubin et al. [10] proved that {𝑌 (0),𝑌 (1)} ⊥ 𝑇 | 𝑒(X) under the assumption of unconfoundedness. For binary treatment, the Logistic regression model is commonly used to estimate propensity scores [13].\",\"Outcome Variance refers to the outcome variability among the units in the treatment and control group.

They noted that causal inference is plagued by data heterogeneity, and massive amounts of observational data lack appropriate exploration tools. Causality interpretability is also crucial since users cannot make decisions if they don’t trust the result. Finally, the requirements are listed.\",\"R1 Descriptive subgroup identification. Observational data usually contains a large potential exploration space with many variables. Although traditional data clustering methods can be used to discover clusters, they do not give a corresponding interpretation. Experts mentioned that “Although high-value groups can be manually segmented based on domain knowledge, it often requires multiple attempts of different filtering conditions.” Users can take advantage of automatically identified subgroups to further discover interesting causal patterns.\",\"R2 Subgroup understanding and valuation. Subgroups involve rich information such as variables used in subgroup descriptions, value distribution of covariates, treatment effect, and variance scores. Users should be able to browse such information to understand the characteristics of a subgroup. It is necessary for the system to provide a clear and intuitive visualization for subgroups.\",\"R3 Subgroup adjustment and hypothesis. The subgroups automatically discovered by the model may not satisfy users. Experts say that for advertising scenarios, they aim to boost user spending and meet total profit goals. Therefore, when necessary, they will relax the filtering conditions or merge small groups to enlarge the target subgroup. Our approach needs to support users to adjust subgroups. The basis of adjustment could be the understanding of the target subgroup, domain knowledge from users, or the analysis results of what-if tests on new subgroups.\",\"R4 Subgroup comparison and ranking. Users have diverse preferences for causal subgroups. For example, when determining the target audience for advertising, conservative users are willing to choose subgroups that are generally effective and have smaller variances, while risk-takers try subgroups that have stronger effects but may also have greater outcome fluctuations. Therefore, we need to allow users to compare subgroups from multiple perspectives and rank them based on their preferences to select satisfactory subgroups.\",\"R5 Treatment effect validation. Users need to understand why certain treatment effect is estimated and be provided with data evidence to explain their rationality.

For the purpose of understanding and optimizing digital learning and the environments in which it occurs, LA ideally attempts to collect and analyze data that exists in educational repositories such as LMS to assess the behavior of educational communities (Romero & Ventura, 2010). Researchers have synthesized the literature regarding the data analyzed in LA studies and found that log records of learners' interaction with and participation in LMSs was the main data source of LA. For example, Saqr et al. (2018) conducted a systematic review of six empirical studies on LA published before 2017 in the field of medical education. Results showed that most reviewed studies collected data from LMSs or online learning resources. Algayres and Triantafyllou (2020) conducted a scoping review of 49 articles on LA in flipped learning environments. They found that LMS data was the main data source. Log variables such as total login time, time spent on online activities, regularity and engagement were usually extracted from LMS log traces. The analysis of log data, also known as data logging, is a process of making sense of computer-generated records (logs). Log analysis has had extensive adoption in the field of LA for some time, and empirical implications have witnessed its potential for providing valuable feedback for improving the effectiveness of online education. More specifically, it helps instructors understand students' online learning behaviors (Breslow et al., 2013; Cooper & Sahami, 2013; Daradoumis et al., 2013), provide feasible feedback and to adjust instructional strategies (Dietz-Uhler & Hurn, 2013).\",\"Note\",\"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in assessment has enabled a more continuous view of individual's ongoing engagement with an online learning environment, rather than discrete snapshots of performance provided by traditional assessments (Swiecki et al., 2022). AI techniques have been applied to different assessment tasks and evidence, such as electronic assessment platforms, stealth assessment, latent knowledge estimation and learning processes. By analyzing data generated from these approaches, previous research has investigated the following: test-taken behaviors (eg, time-on-task, answering and revising behavior during exams) (Lee et al., 2019), formative assessment using stealth methods (Yang et al., 2021), knowledge tracing (Molenaar et al., 2021) and analyzing multichannel data (eg, clickstreams, eye-tracking, mouse movements) in multimodal LA with different AI techniques such as process mining and network analysis (de Marcos et al., 2016; Saqr et al., 2020). A wealth of such research has made student academic performance analysis and prediction become two widely explored research topics in LA.\",\"Log variables investigated in the previous studies can be divided into basic and elaborated types. Basic log variables are those extracted from raw log data and are not specific measurements of previously outlined concepts, such as simple frequency and time counts. This type of log variables (eg, the number of clicks, total time spent online) is the most typical measure used to predict student learning performance. For instance, total login time was found to be positively related to final course grade (eg, Conijn et al., 2017; Wei et al., 2015). However, researchers suggested to extract and aggregate meaningful and elaborated indicators from log data, rather than basic frequency measures of online events (Hadwin et al., 2007; Huang & Fang, 2013; You, 2016). Huang and Fang (2013) claimed that merely adding more basic variables does not improve the predictability of mathematical models. Therefore, researchers need to develop significant indicators that effectively capture online engagement. For example, the variable of regular study (ie, the degree to which a student consistently accesses the learning materials) was generated in some studies based on the notion that self-regulated learners show a typical characteristic of studying on a regular basis (eg, Conijn et al., 2017; Jo et al., 2015; You, 2016). Results in these studies showed learners who regularly logged into the LMS throughout the course showed better performance. Such elaborated time-based indicators can serve as leading factors of student access time and study patterns simultaneously (You, 2016). These indicators explain learners' sustained endeavors and awareness of their learning status better than either login time or login frequency. A similar log variable of distributed learning was examined in Theobald et al. (2018), which was a measure of the number of weeks in which each student had accessed the LMS irrespective of the actual amount of time students spent online. Higher values suggested a more distributed and continual engagement with the course content. It was found that distributed learning was associated with better exam grades.\",\"Log variables can also be classified as generic variables (eg, total login time, total number of clicks) and course-specific variables generated from interactions with specific online activities required in course syllabus (eg, number of weeks of high engagement with summative exercises, weekly use of course videos for the pre-class activities). For better investigating the relationship between online participation and academic performance, some studies have used both kinds of variables into analysis (eg, Jovanović et al., 2019, 2021; Wei et al., 2015). For course-specific log variables, different learning designs used in the courses can potentially lead to different activities in LMSs thus resulting in different LMS usage. As a result, these course-specific predictors cannot be compared across courses. In the present review study, meta regression analysis was conducted only on generic log variables.\",\"Many previous studies analyzed LMS data of one or only a few courses and learning tasks, which makes it difficult to compare study results and draw generalizable conclusions in the ways of using LMS data for predictive modeling (Conijn et al., 2017). Some studies performed prediction modelling on several courses and found that the effect of student LMS behaviors on students' learning performance differs across courses (eg, Conijn et al., 2017; Gašević et al., 2016). In Conijn et al. (2017)'s study, several log variables, such as the total number of views and clicks, had a positive relationship with students' grade in some courses while showed a negative relationship in others. These contradicting results may be explained by the fact that the courses differed in characteristics such as type, theme and learning design. For example, students taking fully online courses show more online interactions with LMSs compared with blended courses, which might have a great possibility of contributing to the effect of log variables on student academic performance. Furthermore, the dependent variable used in prediction models were not all the same. Some studies performed regression analysis to investigate the relationships between log variables and total course score (eg, Bravo-Agapito et al., 2021; Jovanović et al., 2021), while others used final exam score or post-test score (eg, Schumacher & Ifenthaler, 2021; Ulfa & Fatawi, 2021). Final exam score and post-test score are the one-time exams and tests which assess learners' knowledge acquired through the courses or learning modules. Total course score is the sum of all assessment parts of the course, which typically covers both final exam score (if there is) and the grade weights of the course design such as assignments, discussion forums, and quizzes. Therefore, the current study examines whether the predictive power of log variables on final exam score and total course score differs.\",\"In the current empirical studies on LA, researchers investigated the predictive power of log variables in different learning contexts, mainly including learning type (fully online or blended), learning theme (eg, STEM, culture and arts), and the type of the dependent variable in prediction models (total course score or final exam score). Furthermore, the study characteristic variable of sample size that has been examined in many published meta-analysis articles was also considered in the current study. Therefore, a total of four potential moderators (ie, sample size, learning type, learning theme, the type of the dependent variable) would be examined in this meta-analysis. We aim to provide a review with meta-analysis of log variables that have been found to be significant predictors for student academic performance, compare the effect size of basic and elaborated, generic and course-specific log variables and investigate whether the effect size of generic log variables will change according to the four moderating factors.\"]},\"159\":{\"h\":\"RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE AND OBJECTIVES\",\"t\":[\"Improving academic performance is considered one of the crucial issues for education. In the existing literature, numerous studies have adopted LA approach to explore the relationships between log variables and student academic performance in the hope of providing guidance for instructors to make decisions. For example, instructors can encourage students in engaging online learning activities if they are less active during a longer period.\",\"Recently, researchers have reviewed the literature to examine different aspects of applying LA to gain insights for monitoring student learning in digital environments, such as data sources, data analysis techniques, purposes and LA applications on some topics (eg, evaluation and assessment of student academic performance). Among them, several studies reviewed certain log variables used in predicting academic performance. For example, Namoun and Alshanqiti (2021) conducted a systematic literature review of 62 studies between 2010 and 2020 to investigate the applications of data mining and LA techniques in predicting student performance. Results showed that most studies employed regression and supervised ML models to predict student performance. Online engagement in learning activities, term assessment grades, and student academic emotions were the most evident predictors of learning performance. Ifenthaler and Yau (2020) reviewed 46 empirical studies published from 2013 to 2018 to investigate the effective role of LA in facilitating study success in the context of higher education. Results showed that one set of predictors for student success was variables extracted from online log traces which represented student online interactions and engagement, such as login frequency and submission of assignments.\",\"Although some review studies found log data to be the main data sources of LA and summarized several log variables for predicting student academic performance, few studies further systematically provided a fine-grained summary of the influential log variables. Furthermore, despite the increase of LA research, there is no consensus to date on how LA might be implemented, eg, which data is useful, what different considerations have to be made regarding course characteristics, etc. (Agudo-Peregrina et al., 2014). It indicates that there is a need for further studies to investigate the issue of the generalizability of prediction models. Especially regarding the predictors, there is still a lack of comprehensive review of the log variables used in the context of predicting student academic achievement, especially, whether the effect of log variables on student academic achievement varies according to different learning contexts.\",\"Thus, this study sets out to fill the gaps by providing a systematic review with a meta-analysis of log variables and their performance in predicting student academic achievement. In this regard, this paper investigates the studies from the body of research published in the most recent decade.

Furthermore, the effect sizes of different types of log variables were compared, in order to provide a deep understanding of how LA studies investigated log data.\"]},\"188\":{\"h\":\"Influential log variables\",\"t\":[\"Based on the systematic review, we found that there is no wide variation in the learning type, the dependent variable of regression models, and the generic or course-specific log variables investigated in the reviewed studies. However, most reviewed studies investigated STEM courses and learning tasks. Furthermore, most log variables were generated from the basic frequency and time counts. Although only a small number of elaborated log variables were found to be significantly associated with academic achievement, the vigorous development of AI affords opportunities to improve the assessment of processes and enables the various possibility of the extraction and aggregation of log data: further calculation (eg, ratio, entropy), theory-driven LA-based variables (eg, regularity, procrastination), and network analysis-based variables (eg, density, centrality). Furthermore, variables are extracted from multichannel data, based on activities on not just LMSs but also AI-based tools (eg, e-book, video annotation application, notetaking, highlighting and bookmarks), which implies that promising directions for assessing learning processes are being developed with different AI techniques. The review results also show that the generation of some log variables varies across studies. For example, some studies investigated regularity of study time or regularity of study interval, which was calculated based on standard deviation. However, the log variable of regular study in the work of You (2016) was calculated based on the virtual attendance score. It indicates a lack of a uniform paradigm in generating complex log variables.\",\"Among 12 generic log variables that were most frequently found to be significant in predicting academic achievement, most of them showed positive effects in some courses and learning tasks but negative in others. Only the positive effect of number of online sessions and negative effects of starting learning late and regularity of study interval were found in all the reviewed studies. A session was defined as the sequence of behavior from the first click after the login to the LMS until the last click before logging out, or the last click before staying inactive for at least 40 minutes (Conijn et al., 2017). The number of online sessions is a basic indicator that reflects student active interactions with the LMSs. Starting late is a measure of the time until the first activity, which is a more complex predictor relating to time management. Regularity of study interval is calculated by standard deviation of the study intervals. Therefore, this variable technically means the “irregular study”. It indicates that the association between log variables that reflect regular study and time management behaviors and academic achievement was steadier across different learning contexts. Positive effect of regular study on student learning has been confirmed in many studies (eg, Conijn et al., 2017; You, 2016). You (2016) pointed out that successful students would actively participate in their learning, such as regularly accessing online courses and completing assignments in a timely manner. Furthermore, previous studies also demonstrated the detrimental effects of starting to learn late on learning success (eg, Levy & Ramin, 2012; Michinov et al., 2011). Therefore, students who start the course early, regularly access the course and actively participate in the learning activities would be more likely to have a higher grade.\"]},\"189\":{\"h\":\"Moderator analyses\",\"t\":[\"We performed a meta-regression on eleven generic log variables. Only regularity of study time was not suitable for the moderator analysis. The significant effect was found on other ten log variables. Mean effect sizes of these log variables show that login time, frequency on course pages, number of online sessions and largest period of inactivity positively impact student academic achievement, while starting late, regularity of study interval and late submission have a negative impact. Not all moderators influence the effect sizes of these log variables on all levels. For the moderator role of sample range, only regularity of study interval, time-on-task, number of online sessions and starting late are significantly moderated. For the learning type, it only significantly moderates the effect size of regularity of study interval. Students who regularly participate in fully online learning would have higher grades than studying blended courses. This result is logical because student academic achievement in fully online courses basically depends on how students perform online learning activities. The learning theme only significantly moderates the effect sizes of regularity of study interval, time-on-task, and number of online sessions, and starting late. The type of dependent variable in the regression models significantly moderates the effect size of regularity of study interval, starting late and late submission. These results suggest that the effect sizes of log variables relating to regular study, time management and active interactions vary across different courses and learning tasks. For building generalizable prediction models for multiple courses, more theoretical reasoning is needed to aggregate effective and meaningful log predictors that accurately reflect underlying concepts and can be widely applied, for exam ple, optimizing the measurements of regular study and distributed learning across courses based on learning theories and a more fine-grained disentanglement of learning content. In order to do so, we need to better understand what the measurements are actually measuring, what the effect is and how to translate it into specific measures of previously defined theoretical concepts (Conijn et al., 2017). This necessitates the introduction of theories into LA. As suggested by Gašević et al. (2015), Gašević et al. (2016), Wise and Shaffer (2015), theory-driven LA can help researchers gain more dynamic and replicable insights into the learning process rather than the static prediction of academic outcomes in a single case.\"]},\"190\":{\"h\":\"Difference in effect size\",\"t\":[\"We found that there was no difference of the effect sizes between generic and course-specific log variables, while a significant difference between the basic and elaborated was found. Even though the generic and course-specific log variables have no significant difference in the prediction power, previous research has found that predictive models with only generic indicators were able to explain only a small portion of the overall variability in the students' course performance (Jovanović et al., 2019). It has also emphasized the quality of learning behaviors rather than the quantity of learning (Jo & Kim, 2013; You, 2015; You, 2016). As we mentioned in the previous section, theory-driven LA is needed for better conversion of log data into elaborated variables. For example, guided by the theory of self-regulated learning (SRL), You (2016) found that the variable of regular study was a more persuasive indicator than simple frequency measures. It further proves the crucial role theory plays in justifying selecting variables, developing models and interpreting results. Therefore, more complex variables based on well-defined theoretical frameworks warrants consideration.\"]},\"191\":{\"h\":\"LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH\",\"t\":[\"Although the present review study provides insight into the effect of influential log variables on student academic achievement, there are still some limitations. First, we only focused on the statistically significant log variables in regression analysis. Future review studies can examine why some log variables were significant in some studies while insignificant in others. Second, not all categorical levels of some moderators were available in some generic log variables, which limits the meta-regression analysis. Future research could broaden the scope of the search to obtain more diverse metadata. Third, we did not examine the prediction for students at risk of failing a course or student dropout which deals with a categorical dependent variable. Further research can be conducted on this issue.\",\"Regarding the direction of future research on predicting student academic achievement, most reviewed studies mainly examined frequency and time duration log variables. Additional elaborated indicators that reflect students' levels of engagement, motivation (eg, effort, persistence), and decision-making in online learning should be explored and tested in this field. This requires the integration of educational and learning theories and LA, such as, how well learners self-regulate their learning and how learners build connections with others. Furthermore, the application of AI in assessment brings a new set of challenges, for example, the sidelining of professional expertise in automated decision-making generated by AI approaches (Swiecki et al., 2022). Researchers can study on making AI-based assessments more explainable to the teacher for balancing between AI and teacher decision-making on teaching, learning, and assessment.\"]},\"192\":{\"h\":\"CONCLUSIONS\",\"t\":[\"The present study reviewed 88 empirical studies on using log variables to predict student academic achievement.

Additionally, we conduct a challenging task-based evaluation of the individual specialist support agents, where we demonstrate our LLM agents significantly outperform a much larger general-purpose LLM (GPT-4) as well as one from its own medium-size class (LLaMA-2 70B).\"]},\"196\":{\"h\":\"Introduction\",\"t\":[\"Figure 1:High level overview of our LLM constellation architecture Polaris.\",\"Note\",\"(a)Overview of our architecture, comprising of the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for speech transcription, Polaris for processing the textual utterances, and Text-To-Speech (TTS) for the audio output.

Overall, Polaris is strikingly close to human nurse performance, and even outperforms them on some key dimensions.\",\"Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown their impressive capability to plan, reason and interact with humans for a variety of tasks such as web search web, coding Bird et al. (2023), and intelligent content creation Ray (2023). The scaling of LLMs and the datasets used to train them, together with new architectural advances has contributed greatly to the advances in AI capabilities, and shown to surpass human performance in various benchmark tasks sur. These new capabilities are enabling real-world applications that were impossible until very recently such as those in healthcare.\",\"Healthcare specialization. Amidst the several domains and applications, healthcare remains a high-stake domain where errors may have fatal implications. The advent of GPT-4 Achiam et al. (2023) has led to a profound surge in the use of AI for healthcare applications, including clinical note and electronic health record processing (see Lee et al. (2023) for overview). While systems like MedPALM Singhal et al. (2023a) and GPT-4 have shown impressive results in general medical benchmarks like USMLE, recent work shows significant error rate for more specialized use-cases like pediatrics Barile et al. (2024). Among the failures, researchers observe that the AI systems struggle to spot known relationships between conditions that an experienced physician would look for, e.g., for a patient with autism, a physician might check for dietary deficiencies. Jacobsen and DeNiro (2017). The researchers note that these systems could be improved by selectively training on accurate and high quality medical literature, not just general articles over the internet, which are typically what most LLMs are trained on. Furthermore, it is possible that the base knowledge about autism leading to nutrient deficiencies is present in the LLMs; what is missing is the medical reasoning to connect the dots (i.e., some patients with autism exhibit narrow dietary preferences, which can then lead to nutrient deficiencies).\",\"Conversational Healthcare Systems. Most of the existing works for generative AI in healthcare are focused on tasks like medical question-answering Singhal et al. (2023b) and EHR summarization Veen et al. (2024). There are very few works focusing on natural dialogue between caregivers and patients. More recently, Tu et al. developed Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) Tu et al. (2024a), which outlines the importance of diagnostic dialogue to enable physicians to make diagnoses and develop management plans. AMIE is presented as a tool for physicians, and focused on diagnostic use cases. There remains a gap in work addressing the broader range of conversations between a care team and a patient that are neither diagnostic, nor directed to clinical decision making, such as inquiring whether a patient is adhering to their prescription, whether they are following the physician’s pre- and post-procedure directions, and general wellness check-ins. While non-diagnostic, these conversations must still be medically accurate, and critically, must build rapport and trust with the patient to make them feel safe, supported, and confident in their care, while communicating with empathy and bedside manner. Such relationship has shown to lead to better patient satisfaction and, ultimately, better outcomes in real world Derksen et al. (2013). General-purpose LLM’s, however, are not optimized for such objectives. Furthermore, these LLM’s are also not optimized for real-time, voice-based conversations, which can be quite different from text-based conversations. For instance, factors such as response length, quality of voice, pauses and interrupts greatly impact the subjective experience.\",\"The case for AI-based Healthcare Agents. The US healthcare industry is facing a massive shortage of healthcare workers, that became even more apparent after the COVID-19 pandemic ora. Exacerbated by burnout, stress and financial conditions, 16.7% of hospitals anticipated a critical staffing shortage in 2023 according to the Department of Health and Human Service AHA. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the need to fill over 200,000 nursing positions every year until 2031 Fac. A 2023 survey found that 28.7% percent of nurses were considering to leave their jobs. The trend in the decline of the US workforce indicates a shortage of more than 4 million workers nationwide by 2026 ora. In the meantime, the demand for healthcare continues to grow as the population continues to age. There are currently 46 million adults over 65, and it will increase to 64 million by 2030, and 90 million by 2050 Agi.\",\"Given this massive gap in supply and demand for healthcare workers, and the recent promise of Generative AI to supercharge productivity, we focus on developing a non-diagnostic technology for healthcare workforce augmentation, which we denote as super-staffing. In this work, we develop autonomous generative AI healthcare agents that can safely converse with patients on medical topics. Our goal is to improve patient healthcare outcomes by providing a scalable and safe system that can handle non-diagnostic communications. Such a system will allow the human healthcare providers to focus on top-of-license diagnostic and clinical tasks, thereby helping to alleviate staffing shortages. The agents are designed with built-in safety guardrails that ensure appropriate human supervision.\",\"Our solution is a multi-agent system with highly specialized healthcare LLMs. The following are the primary contributions of our work.\",\"Architecture and Training. We develop a unique multi-agent LLM constellation architecture optimized for real-time healthcare conversation. We employ a primary conversational agent with several specialist support agents for a patient-friendly and medically accurate conversation. The primary agent is trained to be aligned with nurse-like conversations geared for building trust, rapport and empathy with patients, as well as accomplishing healthcare-specific tasks typically performed by nurses, medical assistants, social workers, and nutritionists. We develop techniques to make the primary agent stateful to navigate through a long checklist of care protocols. Our support agents are specialized in healthcare tasks that require a high-level of accuracy, such as confirming that the patient’s reported medicine consumption aligns with the dosage prescribed by their physician, determining whether the patient’s reported OTC drug consumption is within the manufacturer’s recommended range, understanding which medicine the patient is referring to (i.e., patients often struggle with correctly pronouncing drug names, and may confuse ones that sound similar), retrieving current and historical lab results from the patient’s EHR, guiding the patient’s food choices to align with their prescribed diet, etc. The specialist agents provide the relevant context to the primary agent in a message-passing framework, which drives the main conversation.To this end, we develop custom training protocols for conversational alignment using organic healthcare conversations and simulated ones using patient actors and nurses (U.S. licensed) with agents- and clinicians-in-the-loop for co-operative learning.\",\"Safety. We adopt a three-pronged approach to safety comprised of: (1) A 70B-100B primary model trained using evidence based content; (2) a novel constellation architecture with multiple models totaling over one trillion parameters, in which a primary LLM is supervised by multiple specialist support models to improve medical accuracy and substantially reduce hallucinations; (3) built-in guardrails that bring in a human supervisor when necessary.\",\"Evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, we perform the first extensive real-world evaluation of a healthcare LLM system in which we recruited over 1100 US-licensed nurses and over 130 U.S.-licensed physicians posing as patients for our system. This is focused on an integrated system-level conversational evaluation on dimensions such as medical safety, readiness and bedside manners where we demonstrate parity with human nurses on several key metrics. We also perform a challenging component-level evaluation where we demonstrate that our medium-size specialized agents massively outperform a much larger state-of-the-art general-purpose LLM (GPT-4) on the healthcare tasks as well as outperform an LLM from its own parameter size class (LLaMA-2 70B).\"]},\"197\":{\"h\":\"2. System Overview\",\"t\":[\"Polaris is architected as a constellation of a primary and multiple specialist LLMs. It also includes the supporting system which orchestrates control flow, inter-model message passing and maintains conversation state. The system is designed to achieve better domain-specific interactions compared to a single general purpose LLM. The healthcare conversation domain is apt for showcasing the value of this paradigm as there are many competing objectives and requirements, including a special emphasis on safety and verification. We further explain the problem domain, system architecture and also provide relevant details on the constituent models in the following sections.\"]},\"198\":{\"h\":\"2.1 Objectives and Use Cases\",\"t\":[\"We develop Polaris for patient-facing, real-time healthcare conversation. The objective of this system is to perform low risk non-diagnostic tasks typically performed by nurses, medical assistants, social workers, and nutritionists. The system is constructed for voice-based interaction, as phone calls are the dominant method of communication for many high-volume and high-value healthcare use cases. Building a voice-based autonomous agent is a challenging problem due to factors such as voice quality, pitch, tone, response length, interruptions, and communication delay. Additionally, Polaris has to take into account errors introduced by the Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) system in the transcription of the audio signal, with a particular focus on the complexity of recognizing healthcare-specific words and phrases (e.g., complex medication names and lab values).\",\"We train our healthcare agents to accomplish a number of tasks that can be completed via phone calls or voice-only interactions. Typical objectives for these tasks include general check-in on patient wellness, reviewing compliance with prescribed medicine regimes, confirming appointment details, reviewing procedural logistics, performing diet reviews, communicating lab results, etc. Given that the number of tasks in a typical care protocol can be quite large and extensive, the agent must be able to maintain and update conversation state with each patient, ensuring that all tasks are completed. The task completion rate directly impacts the success rate for the call. At the same time, we train these agents to have natural conversations that mimic what human caregivers would say, rather than a mere question-answering system as in prior works. For instance, the agent must be able to answer any question the patients may have, address their concerns, and otherwise handle tangential discussions in the conversation. This makes it particularly challenging for the agent to engage in deep conversations with the patient, given that the style, tone and content of these conversations can be quite different from the model’s original training dataset. Such conversation fluidity coupled with its state awareness and medical accuracy remains at the crux of all our design and architectural decisions. Furthermore, we design our system to build trust and rapport with patients, learning about their personality and preferences to demonstrate good bedside manner and leading to higher patient satisfaction and potentially better health outcomes. Our system is deeply specialized in many different medical conditions and procedures. For the purpose of this report, we highlight three representative outbound-call use cases including follow-up calls for post-discharge congestive heart failure (CHF), ongoing care for chronic kidney disease (CKD), and pre-operative check-in for colonoscopy. Figure 2 shows an overview of the different capabilities of our system.\",\"Key Information\",\"Typical objectives\",\"general check-in on patient wellness,\",\"reviewing compliance with prescribed medicine regimes,\",\"confirming appointment details,\",\"reviewing procedural logistics,\",\"performing diet reviews,\",\"communicating lab results,\",\"etc.\"]},\"199\":{\"h\":\"2.2 Constellation Architecture\",\"t\":[\"Figure 2: Overview of our training framework for Polaris with registered nurses, patient actors, and LLM agents in the loop.\",\"The core part of Polaris is the multi-agent LLM constellation. As opposed to a general large model performing many different tasks with varying performance, we break down the faculty into medium-size specialist models with consistent high performance. This is beneficial in settings like ours to optimize for tasks with competing objectives, while keeping the latency low for a real-time application. For instance, this allows us to optimize the primary language model for conversational fluidity, rapport-building and empathetic bedside manner with patients.\",\"Simultaneously, we focus on developing specialized agents with capabilities that serve a dual purpose: (a) assist the main LLM with relevant healthcare-specific context (e.g., A patient with chronic kidney disease stage 3b is recommended to avoid common NSAIDs like advil, motrin); (b) provide a layer of safety to double-check the information provided by the main model (e.g., 40mg of Lasix twice a day vs. 80mg of Lasix once a day). Each of these agents is tied to specific abilities such as confirming that the patient’s reported medicine consumption aligns with the dosage prescribed by their physician, determining whether the patient’s reported OTC drug consumption is within the manufacturer’s recommended range, understanding which medicine the patient is referring to (i.e., patients often struggle with correctly pronouncing drug names, and may confuse ones that sound similar) retrieving current and historical lab results from the patient’s EHR, guiding the patient’s food choices to align with their prescribed diet, etc.\",\"While Polaris has many such agents, we focus on only a subset of them for illustration. Finally, these agents co-operate to solve a complex task. For instance, the patient utterance ‘‘I am taking dulaglutide. I saw my hemoglobin a1c was 5 - is that normal?’’ requires both the lab agent and the medication agent to work together with the primary agent to formulate the response ‘‘a hemoglobin a1c of 5 is within the normal range and lower than your previous value of 6.5. Your dulaglutide does decrease your hemoglobin a1c level’’.\"]},\"200\":{\"h\":\"2.3 Orchestration\",\"t\":[\"The internal state of Polaris evolves as a result of the primary agent’s interactions with the user and the message passing conducted by the support agents. To explain this more clearly we adopt the following notation for the system components:\",\"Agents: Let A={A1​,A2​,...,An​} be the set of agents, where A1​ is the primary agent and A2​,...,An​ are the support agents.\",\"Conversation History: Let Ht​={(u1​,r1​),(u2​,r2​),...,(ut−1​,rt−1​)} be the conversation history up to turn t, where ui​ is the user utterance and ri​ is the response of the primary agent at turn i.\",\"Agent-Specific Prompts: Let PAi​​(Ht​) be the prompt for agent Ai​ at turn t, derived from the vonversation history Ht​.\",\"Support Agent Outputs: Let OAi​​(PAi​​) be the output of support agent Ai​ given prompt PAi​​. The output space is structured with expected fields, i.g., OAi​​={f1​:v1​,f2​:v2​,...}, where fi​ are the fields and vj​ are the values.\",\"State Changes: Let St​ be the state of Polaris at turn t. The sate changes based on the outputs of the support agents, i.e., St+1​=Update(St​,OA2​​,OA3​​,...,OAn​​)\",\"Prompts: The prompt for the primary agent at turn t+1 is a function of the updated state and the conversation history, i.e., PA1​​(Ht+1​，St+1​).\",\"Short-Horizon Tasks: These can be represented as additional prompt snippets, e.g., Tt+1​={task1​,task2​,...}, which are appended to the primary agent's prompt based on the state changes. Polaris mediates the message passing between agents with deterministic imperative programming. This allows us to keep the output space of the support agents well-constrained and implement control-flow logic to support customized protocols. The tasks which are given to the primary agent are systematically formatted and use synthesized information from multiple agents when applicable. This framework facilitates a cooperative approach to complex dialogue generation, where multiple agents contribute to the overall conversation dynamics. An overall step of the constellation system is described in Algorithm 1.\"]},\"201\":{\"h\":\"2.4 LLM Details\",\"t\":[\"Our LLM architecture designs and training choices are constrained by the requirement to serve the model in real-time as part of our LLM constellation. As a result, we employ a diverse set of LLMs for the support agents ranging from 50B to 100B parameters, whereas the primary agent is always a medium-size LLM (70B - 100B parameters). All of our models follow a decoder-only transformer-based architecture, and contain between 30 and 100 layers. We use Grouped Query Attention (GQA) Ainslie et al. (2023) to achieve faster inference speeds and reduced memory footprint when storing the KV cache during inference, which in turns allows us to serve larger batch sizes for increased throughput. Different models use different tokenizers depending on the use case and the need for specialized medical terminologies (such as drug names), with vocabulary sizes ranging from 30,000 to 200,000 tokens. The implementation of the attention mechanism employs Flash Attention 2 Dao (2023), which makes the training and inference stages faster, with lower memory footprint and more efficient scaling to longer sequence lengths. All of our models use RMSNorm normalization layers Zhang and Sennrich (2019), SwiGLU activation functions Shazeer (2020), and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) Su et al. (2024). The maximum context window varies from model to model, ranging from 4,096 to 32,768 tokens. The training runs were performed using a distributed, multi-GPU setup, using several hundred Nvidia H100 GPUs with DeepSpeed Rasley et al. (2020).\",\"The primary agent is trained in 3 stages: General Instruction Tuning, Conversation and Agent Tuning, and RLHF. The training and dataset details for the primary agent are discussed in Section 3. The rest of the models are trained using human-labeled datasets, as defined in the respective sections for each agent.\",\"During inference, we deploy some of our models in bf16 precision and others in int8 precision (using weight-only quantization), depending on the latency and accuracy requirements.\",\"Key Information\",\"Primary agent training\",\"General Instruction Tuning\",\"Conversation and Agent Tuning\",\"RLHF\"]},\"202\":{\"h\":\"3 Conversational Alignment\",\"t\":[\"In the healthcare domain, the development of a patient-focused clinical framework requires an intelligent conversational agent.

This challenge is compounded by the lack of datasets specifically tailored for training models in the nuanced context of healthcare conversations. Our work addresses this critical gap by leveraging a unique compilation of dialogues, including simulated interactions between registered nurses and patient actors. These dialogues form the cornerstone of our approach to developing a conversational agent with the proficiency to navigate a wide array of clinical discussions. To enhance the agent’s reasoning capabilities, instruction-following proficiency, and domain-specific knowledge – we augmented these datasets by introducing diverse kinds of instructions and tasks geared for multi-hop reasoning. For instance, given a user utterance “my shoes do not fit”, the agent should be able to reason about “swollen ankle → sign of fluid retention → sign of exacerbating CHF conditions”.\"]},\"204\":{\"h\":\"3.1.1 Foundation Model Training Data\",\"t\":[\"We first train our foundation model on a massive collection of proprietary data including clinical care plans, healthcare regulatory documents, medical manuals, drug databases, and other high-quality medical reasoning documents.

We further annotated some of the medical datasets with reasoning chains to further enhance the medical reasoning capabilities of the model. Figure 31 shows one of the examples of the medical question answers we leveraged for training our foundation model.\"]},\"205\":{\"h\":\"3.1.2 Simulated Conversations\",\"t\":[\"The nature of our conversational objectives requires specialized data. The agent should be able to maintain conversational state over relatively large time horizon; a multi-turn call in our setting often exceeds 20 minutes with several dozen turns from each speaker. It is important to generate data which portrays tougher trajectories within the healthcare setting of our calls. Our system must be robust to handling patients with diverse profiles, for instance, high engagement with many questions or concerns; low regimen compliance; skepticism of AI health services, etc.\",\"We thus rely on the domain expertise of medical professionals, US-licensed nurses in our setting, to generate accurate data which exhibits comprehensive coverage of our desired data distribution. We leverage a large number of registered nurses, patient actors and our AI-in-the-loop to generate simulated conversations. For targeted medical conditions (e.g., CHF, CKD) and procedures (e.g., post-discharge, pre-operative, chronic-care followups), clinicians create conversational scripts (refer to Table 3 for a simplified version of our CHF script). We also create a large number of fictional patient profiles with different medical histories, condition severity, medications, labs, lifestyle and personality traits (refer to Table4 for a sample patient profile).\",\"We require clinical expertise to train all parts of Polaris. In order to do this, we employ a bootstrapping strategy for data generation. Initially, we generate conversations using registered nurses and patient actors. We design these conversations to cover a wide breadth of scenarios and behaviors on the part of the simulated patient. We give specific instructions to patient actors to converse such that many of the specialist agents are triggered, such as asking complex questions about medications, mispronouncing medicine names, providing deliberately confusing lab results (e.g., a blood glucose reading in response to a request for their blood pressure reading), asking about hospital specific information (e.g., where to park), etc. During these conversations the registered nurse annotates the transcripts for when these events occurred and what the specialist agents should do during corresponding turns.\",\"We then proceed to train both the primary and support agents from this collection of datasets. This allows us to start using our trained agents in the conversation instead of nurses; their responses are reviewed by registered nurses with potential re-writes for the noisy turns. We also employ instruction tuned language models to perform data cleaning and augmentation. This is used to improve the style of responses and also create additional variety, preventing mode collapse in the primary agent distribution and ensuring robustness in the support agents. Like most bootstrapping situations, this process becomes more effective with more rounds of training, which allows generalization to new scripts, medications, and so on. Here we provide more details on the entities which participate in the data generation process.\",\"Patient Actors. Here the actors are asked to play the role of a fictional patient and portray a realistic patient experience. They are encouraged to use the fictional patient’s background as well as their personal experiences and feelings to guide them. We provide them with sample instructions, for instance: Ask about lab values - what they mean, whether they’re normal or not; state they’re taking the wrong medication dosages, or that they are taking medications not on their chart, and so on.\",\"Registered Nurses. We ask the nurses to play the role of an ideal nurse at the bedside, on the phone, or in their community. While we provide them with the conversational script with defined call objectives, they are encouraged not to follow the order strictly, but instead follow the natural conversation trajectory for a realistic experience. This allows the patient at times to go on tangents, for instance, sharing their personal experiences that the nurse can engage with to develop rapport and trust; share their health concerns and symptoms that the nurse can both empathize with and educate on.\",\"Our AI-in-the-Loop. Once our models are tuned with conversations generated from the earlier phases, we further use them to generate synthetic conversations. Here, the AI plays the role of a nurse with the conversational script and meta instructions used in the prompt as a preamble to converse with the patient actors. This stage is required primarily for tuning our support agents (discussed in Section 7) that generate tasks and provide relevant context to condition the primary agent to generate the response. After our support agent system is sufficiently tuned, we proceed to RLHF data generation. For this we sample multiple responses from the primary agent for the full prompt constructed from the meta-prompt, conversation history and support agent tasks.

The skull protects the brain and forms the shape of the face. The spinal cord, a pathway for messages between the brain and the body, is protected by the backbone, or spinal column. The ribs form a cage that shelters 【the】 heart and lungs, and the pelvis helps protect the bladder, part of the intestines, and in women, the reproductive organs. Bones are made up of a framework of a protein called collagen, with a mineral called calcium phosphate that makes the framework hard and strong. Bones store calcium and release some into the bloodstream when it's needed by other parts of the body. The amounts of certain vitamins and minerals that you eat, especially vitamin D and calcium, directly affect how much calcium is stored in the bones. Joints are where 【two】 bones meet. They make the skeleton flexible- without them, movement would be impossible. Joints allow our bodies to move in many ways. Some joints open and close like a hinge- such as knees and elbows, whereas others allow for more complicated movement- a shoulder or hip joint, for example, allows for backward, forward, sideways, and rotating movement. Joints are classified by their range of movement: Immovable, or fibrous, joints don't move. The dome of the skull, for example, is made of bony plates, which move slightly during birth and then fuse together as the skull finishes growing. Between the edges of these plates are links, or joints, of fibrous tissue. Fibrous joints also hold the teeth in the jawbone. Partially movable, or cartilaginous, joints move a little. They are linked by cartilage, as in the spine. Each of the vertebrae in the spine moves in relation to the one above and below it, and together these movements give the spine its flexibility. Freely movable, or synovial- pronounced: sih- NO- vee- ul, joints move in many directions. The 【main】 joints of the body- such as those found at the hip, shoulders, elbows, knees, wrists, and ankles- are freely movable. They are filled with synovial fluid, which acts as a lubricant to help the joints move easily. 【Three】 kinds of freely movable joints play a big part in voluntary movement: Hinge joints allow movement in one direction, as seen in the knees and elbows. Pivot joints allow a rotating or twisting motion, like that of the head moving from side to side. Ball- and- socket joints allow the greatest freedom 【of】 movement. The hips and shoulders have this type of joint, in which the round end of a long bone fits into the hollow of another bone.\"]},\"531\":{\"h\":\"World Map of Happiness\",\"t\":[\"Bhutan used to be one of the most isolated nations in the world.

They are infamous for chewing holes in walls and furniture, and 【destructive】 scraping and hole digging, due to boredom. Border Collies may exhibit a strong desire to herd, a trait they may show with small children, cats, and other dogs.

They placed a 60 centimetre row of randomly spaced beads between two parallel, vertical glass plates 4.5 millimetres apart, with the beads glued to the bottom to simulate the ground under a natural pile. Then they dropped in one bead at a time, creating piles of up to 55, 000 beads. After each drop, the team photographed the pile and measured the position of each bead to calculate the\\\"space factor\\\" a measure of the disorder in the system, which was related to the space surrounding each bead( see diagram). The greater the disorder round a bead, the more likely an avalanche was. If one or more beads moved when a new bead fell on the pile, that was considered to be an avalanche. An extra-large avalanche involved between 317 and 1000 beads. The researchers found that if the space factor before a bead dropped was greater than it had been 50 steps earlier, they could predict an extra-large avalanche with 64 percent accuracy.

It includes three basic steps: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The indexing stage divides the document library into short chunks and builds a vector index. The retrieval stage retrieves relevant document fragments based on the similarity between the question and the chunks. The generation stage generates answers to the questions based on the retrieved context.\",\"Advanced RAG\",\"Advanced RAG is an optimization and enhancement of Naive RAG. It includes additional processing steps, which are performed before and after data indexing and retrieval. It includes more sophisticated data cleaning, document structure design, and metadata addition to improve text consistency, accuracy, and retrieval efficiency. It uses question rewriting, routing, and expansion to align semantic differences between questions and document blocks before retrieval. It avoids the \\\"Lost in the Middle\\\" phenomenon through re-ranking after retrieval, or shortens the window length through context filtering and compression.\",\"Modular RAG\",\"Modular RAG introduces more specific functional modules, such as query search engine, fusion of multiple answers, etc. Technically, it integrates retrieval and fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, etc. In terms of process, RAG modules are designed and arranged, and a variety of different RAG modes appear. Providing greater flexibility, the system can select the appropriate combination of functional modules according to application requirements.

It handles the ambiguity and non-standard nature of user questions, providing clear task objectives for subsequent processes.\",\"Document Parsing\",\"The Document Parsing module processes documents from various sources, including PDFs, PPTs, Neo4j, etc. This module converts document content into a structured format suitable for knowledge retrieval.\",\"Document Indexing\",\"The Document Indexing module segments parsed documents into short chunks and builds vector indexes or uses full-text indexing for text retrieval, enabling the system to quickly find document fragments relevant to user queries.\",\"Vector Embedding\",\"The Vector Embedding module maps content from document indexes into vector representations for similarity calculations. This helps the model understand relationships between documents better, improving the accuracy of knowledge retrieval.\",\"Knowledge Retrieval\",\"The Knowledge Retrieval module calculates similarity scores based on user queries and vector embeddings or text retrieval. This step ensures semantic relevance between queries and documents, ensuring accurate retrieval.\",\"Re-ranking module\",\"The Re-ranking module reorders the document library after knowledge retrieval to avoid the \\\"Lost in the Middle\\\" phenomenon, ensuring the most relevant document fragments appear first.\",\"Large Model Answering\",\"The Large Model Answering module uses large-scale language models to generate final answers. This module integrates retrieved contexts to produce coherent and accurate text responses.\",\"Others\",\"Additional functional modules can be introduced based on specific application requirements, such as query search engines, merging multiple answers, etc. Modular design enhances system flexibility, enabling selection of appropriate functional module combinations for different scenarios.\"]},\"826\":{\"c\":[\"AI\"]},\"827\":{\"h\":\"RAG\"},\"828\":{\"c\":[\"readme\"]},\"829\":{\"h\":\"Excel\"},\"830\":{\"c\":[\"readme\"]},\"831\":{\"h\":\"How to interpret Sensitivity Report\"},\"832\":{\"c\":[\"unisa\"]},\"833\":{\"h\":\"Excel Solver\"},\"834\":{\"c\":[\"unisa\"]},\"835\":{\"h\":\"Google Drive Mount\",\"t\":[\"Official Example: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb#scrollTo=1w7lrGcW08Ds\"]},\"836\":{\"h\":\"Install packages\",\"t\":[\"pip install git+https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools\"]},\"837\":{\"h\":\"There is error\",\"t\":[\"AttributeError: module 'IPython.utils.traitlets' has no attribute 'Unicode'\",\"Solutions: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75666380/attributeerror-module-ipython-utils-traitlets-has-no-attribute-unicode\"]},\"838\":{\"c\":[\"google\"]},\"839\":{\"h\":\"Google Colab\"},\"840\":{\"c\":[\"readme\"]},\"841\":{\"h\":\"Google Colab Techniques\"},\"842\":{\"h\":\"How to make libraries on Google Drive\"},\"843\":{\"h\":\"01.

Fourier developed the idea as a direct result of his research into the flow of heat within solid bodies. Fourier was apparently obsessed with heat, one anecdote tells of him receiving visitors in his rooms with a roaring fire and wearing a heavy overcoat despite the summer temperature. This obsession may have been due to his sojourn in Egypt as a member of Napoleon’s Savants, 165 of the best and brightest of France’s academics. By 1807 he had completed his theory of heat conduction which depended on the idea of analysing temperature distribution of heat within a metal bar into spatially sinusoidal components. Publication was hindered by a lack of support from the great mathematicians of the day, LaPlace, Lagrange and Poisson among others, who expressed doubts as to its veracity. Nevertheless, Fourier’s theory won a prestigious prize for mathematics in 1811 albeit with a caveat mentioning lack of generality and rigor. In fact publication was delayed further until 1815. The problem lay in the fact that Fourier integrals rely on an interval stretching to infinity in all directions. In order to completely characterise the heat distribution in a metal bar the bar would have to be of infinite length as Fourier integrals are, by definition, over the interval [∞, ∞]. Fourier circumvented this difficulty by considering a bar that had been bent into a circle. In this way the temperature is thus forced to be spatially periodic. There is no problem with generality if one supposes the circumference of the circular bar to be larger than the greatest distance that could be of interest on a straight bar conducting heat.\",\"The fomula 2x​=sin(x)−21​sin(2x)+31​sin(3x)...is published by Euler when Fourier was only a boy and forms the basis on which Fourier built his theory.

Firstly, describe the huge volume of data, there are 42P+ volume data exist in company and around 16 thousand tables; for the variety, there are kinds of business data, log, and comments, etc. need to process; for the velocity, there are 150 thousand tasks on MapReduce and Spark per day, the log data with a peak value of one million per second. There are 2500+ nodes are deployed in 3 computer rooms to process all the tasks (2022). It’s obviously that it impossible to process using a normal application. They established application based on Hadoop software to support all the service. The structure of their application like Image 1.1.1.\",\" The applications layer is the business layer, they are all business related, the compute engine layer and basic service layer construct the big data platform, which are what we need to focus on. All the components on the two layers will be described below. HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System, which is a distributed file system (HDFS Architecture Guide, no date). Apache Hadoop YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is a novel resource orchestrator within the Hadoop framework, and a versatile resource governance infrastructure capable of furnishing cohesive resource allocation and scheduling functionalities for superjacent application strata (Apache Hadoop 3.3.6 – Apache Hadoop YARN, no date). The fullname of Hive Meta is Hive Metastore (HMS), which is the paramount depository, it houses the metadata pertaining to Hive tables and partitions within a relational database, affording diverse clients (comprising Hive, Impala, and Spark) the capability to retrieve said information through the utilization of the Metastore service API. (Apache Hive, no date). HBase is Apache HBase™ is the Hadoop database, a distributed, scalable, big data store (Apache HBase – Apache HBaseTM Home, no date). Mapred is a package, which describes how to read and write ORC files from Hadoop’s older org.apache.hadoop.mapred MapReduce APIs (Using in MapRed, no date). Cloud Table is a HBase interface make by Meituan (2022). Apache Kylin stands as an open source, distributed Analytical Data Warehouse; its conception was geared towards furnishing OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) proficiency within the milieu of extensive data landscapes. (Apache Kylin | Analytical Data Warehouse for Big Data, no date). Apache Hive is a distributed and resilient data warehousing system, which empowers extensive-scale analytics, querying, manipulation, and governance of petabytes of data stored across distributed repositories through the SQL.

The structure of Meituan’s platform is well organized, but still have several components can be optimized. I will propose one suggestion on the structure, which is using K8 that is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, to replace yarn for a more flexible capability (Production-Grade Container Orchestration n.d.).\"]},\"1645\":{\"h\":\"1.3 The Advantages\",\"t\":[\"This part will show the advantages for the suggestions proposed on chapter 1.2. For replacement using K8 for YARN, the first thing is to understand the details of the two components, and the limitations of YARN and advantage of K8. For understanding the limitations of YARN, it’s necessary to know how YARN works. A YARN cluster consists of nodes, some of them are Master nodes, and the most Worker nodes. Two resource managers to manage resource at different levels. The ResourceManager handles resources at the cluster level, while NodeManager manages resources at the individual host level. They track vcores and memory at the cluster and localhost level. When an application runs on YARN, the two managers will evaluate the available resources, then assign each container to a host. In this way, the key work of YARN is to manage resources and schedule tasks on the cluster. YARN exhibits limitations like version control, job isolation, and resource allocation. Running diverse workloads mandates separate clusters, escalating complexity and inefficiency. Especially for demanding tasks like real-time processing, YARN's lack of job isolation necessitates frequent cluster setup, causing costs and resource wastage (Kubernetes vs YARN for scheduling Apache Spark n.d.). The next is to understand how K8 works and the benefits from using K8. Kubernetes could use pod to manage different tasks as an isolated container, a pod is a group of containers, and all the tasks run in an isolated environment, no matter which task failed will not influence the whole cluster (Sensu | How Kubernetes works n.d.). After comparation between the YARN and Kubernetes, several benefits will get after using Kubernetes. Such as, containerize applications and dependencies to prevent dependency issues; Kubernetes' Resource Quota and Namespaces enhance control over resource utilization; portable hybrid cloud compatibility achieved with swappable backends for Spark applications; Kubernetes Role and ClusterRole features enable precise permissions based on API groups; Tag container images for version control, aiding auditing and rollback of deployments; flourishing Kubernetes ecosystem offers robust open-source management add-ons like Prometheus, Fluentd, and Grafana. All the benefits are the reasons for the suggestion.\"]},\"1646\":{\"h\":\"1.4 Challenges\",\"t\":[\"The Kubernetes is a great component for dealing with big data. There still have lots of challenges to overcome. The initial hurdle in adopting Kubernetes lies in the requisite expertise, which often lacking in data teams. Proficiency in Kubernetes, Helm, Docker, and networking basics is essential. Despite Kubernetes' prowess in scaling apps, addressing infrastructure scalability remains a task. Efficient cost management amid the need for adaptable infrastructure supporting dynamic applications is another significant challenge. Given the resource-intensive nature of big data tasks involving research, testing, modeling, and experimentation, costs can escalate if not vigilantly managed (Kubernetes vs YARN for scheduling Apache Spark n.d.).\"]},\"1647\":{\"h\":\"Part2\",\"t\":[\"For this part, the Weka will be selected as the tool to implement NaiveBayes Classifier, the original data need to convert into a proper format.

For example, if you intend for the model to copy a particular style of responding to user queries which is difficult to describe explicitly. This is known as \\\"few-shot\\\" prompting.\",\"Specify the desired length of the output You can ask the model to produce outputs that are of a given target length.

Split complex tasks into simpler subtasks\",\"t\":[\"Tactic\",\"Use intent classification to identify the most relevant instructions for a user query For tasks in which lots of independent sets of instructions are needed to handle different cases, it can be beneficial to first classify the type of query and to use that classification to determine which instructions are needed. This can be achieved by defining fixed categories and hardcoding instructions that are relevant for handling tasks in a given category. This process can also be applied recursively to decompose a task into a sequence of stages. The advantage of this approach is that each query will contain only those instructions that are required to perform the next stage of a task which can result in lower error rates compared to using a single query to perform the whole task. This can also result in lower costs since larger prompts cost more to run.\",\"Example\",\"For dialogue applications that require very long conversations, summarize or filter previous dialogue. Since models have a fixed context length, dialogue between a user and an assistant in which the entire conversation is included in the context window cannot continue indefinitely.\",\"There are various workarounds to this problem, one of which is to summarize previous turns in the conversation. Once the size of the input reaches a predetermined threshold length, this could trigger a query that summarizes part of the conversation and the summary of the prior conversation could be included as part of the system message. Alternatively, prior conversation could be summarized asynchronously in the background throughout the entire conversation.\",\"An alternative solution is to dynamically select previous parts of the conversation that are most relevant to the current query. See the tactic \\\"Use embeddings-based search to implement efficient knowledge retrieval\\\".\",\"Summarize long documents piecewise and construct a full summary recursively Since models have a fixed context length, they cannot be used to summarize a text longer than the context length minus the length of the generated summary in a single query.\",\"To summarize a very long document such as a book we can use a sequence of queries to summarize each section of the document. Section summaries can be concatenated and summarized producing summaries of summaries. This process can proceed recursively until an entire document is summarized. If it’s necessary to use information about earlier sections in order to make sense of later sections, then a further trick that can be useful is to include a running summary of the text that precedes any given point in the book while summarizing content at that point. The effectiveness of this procedure for summarizing books has been studied in previous research by OpenAI using variants of GPT-3.\"]},\"1917\":{\"h\":\"4. Give the model time to \\\"think\\\"\",\"t\":[\"Tactic\",\"Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion Sometimes we get better results when we explicitly instruct the model to reason from first principles before coming to a conclusion. Suppose for example we want a model to evaluate a student’s solution to a math problem. The most obvious way to approach this is to simply ask the model if the student's solution is correct or not.\",\"Examples\",\"Use inner monologue or a sequence of queries to hide the model's reasoning process The previous tactic demonstrates that it is sometimes important for the model to reason in detail about a problem before answering a specific question. For some applications, the reasoning process that a model uses to arrive at a final answer would be inappropriate to share with the user. For example, in tutoring applications we may want to encourage students to work out their own answers, but a model’s reasoning process about the student’s solution could reveal the answer to the student.\",\"Inner monologue is a tactic that can be used to mitigate this. The idea of inner monologue is to instruct the model to put parts of the output that are meant to be hidden from the user into a structured format that makes parsing them easy. Then before presenting the output to the user, the output is parsed and only part of the output is made visible.\",\"Ask the model if it missed anything on previous passes Suppose that we are using a model to list excerpts from a source which are relevant to a particular question. After listing each excerpt the model needs to determine if it should start writing another or if it should stop. If the source document is large, it is common for a model to stop too early and fail to list all relevant excerpts. In that case, better performance can often be obtained by prompting the model with followup queries to find any excerpts it missed on previous passes.\",\"Examples\"]},\"1918\":{\"h\":\"5. Use external tools\",\"t\":[\"Compensate for the weaknesses of the model by feeding it the outputs of other tools. For example, a text retrieval system (sometimes called RAG or retrieval augmented generation) can tell the model about relevant documents. A code execution engine like OpenAI's Code Interpreter can help the model do math and run code. If a task can be done more reliably or efficiently by a tool rather than by a language model, offload it to get the best of both.\",\"Tactic\",\"Use embeddings-based search to implement efficient knowledge retrieval A model can leverage external sources of information if provided as part of its input. This can help the model to generate more informed and up-to-date responses. For example, if a user asks a question about a specific movie, it may be useful to add high quality information about the movie (e.g. actors, director, etc…) to the model’s input. Embeddings can be used to implement efficient knowledge retrieval, so that relevant information can be added to the model input dynamically at run-time.\",\"A text embedding is a vector that can measure the relatedness between text strings. Similar or relevant strings will be closer together than unrelated strings. This fact, along with the existence of fast vector search algorithms means that embeddings can be used to implement efficient knowledge retrieval. In particular, a text corpus can be split up into chunks, and each chunk can be embedded and stored. Then a given query can be embedded and vector search can be performed to find the embedded chunks of text from the corpus that are most related to the query (i.e. closest together in the embedding space).\",\"Example implementations can be found in the OpenAI Cookbook. See the tactic “Instruct the model to use retrieved knowledge to answer queries” for an example of how to use knowledge retrieval to minimize the likelihood that a model will make up incorrect facts.\",\"Use code execution to perform more accurate calculations or call external APIs Language models cannot be relied upon to perform arithmetic or long calculations accurately on their own. In cases where this is needed, a model can be instructed to write and run code instead of making its own calculations. In particular, a model can be instructed to put code that is meant to be run into a designated format such as triple backtick. After an output is produced, the code can be extracted and run. Finally, if necessary, the output from the code execution engine (i.e. Python interpreter) can be provided as an input to the model for the next query.\",\"Another good use case for code execution is calling external APIs. If a model is instructed in the proper use of an API, it can write code that makes use of it. A model can be instructed in how to use an API by providing it with documentation and/or code samples showing how to use the API.\",\"Warning\",\"Executing code produced by a model is not inherently safe and precautions should be taken in any application that seeks to do this. In particular, a sandboxed code execution environment is needed to limit the harm that untrusted code could cause.\",\"Example\",\"Give the model access to specific functionsThe Chat Completions API allows passing a list of function descriptions in requests. This enables models to generate function arguments according to the provided schemas. Generated function arguments are returned by the API in JSON format and can be used to execute function calls. Output provided by function calls can then be fed back into a model in the following request to close the loop. This is the recommended way of using OpenAI models to call external functions.
