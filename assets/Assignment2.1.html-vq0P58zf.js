However, support will be limited for alternative tools, and SAS-based presentation remains the guideline for important steps, decisions and results.<br> If you have any questions – feel free to ask on the forum or by email.

So, if there were no payments in April, bill amount for May goes up.</li><li>Negative bill amount (BILL_AMT) is not a mistake, it means that the previous payment was larger that the actual bill and the account has extra cash in it (no debt at all). Negative payment (PAY_AMT) would be a mistake in the data but I have not seen any.</li><li>Variable payment status (PAY_) shows the customer’s status with respect to the same month bill. For example, PAY_6 shows of BILL_AMT6 was paid, however respected payment would be recorded in PAY_AMT5. In general, I found payment status (PAY_) inconsistent and illogical.</li></ol><h2 id="reference" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reference"><span>Reference</span></a></h2><p><a href="https://lo.unisa.edu.au/mod/assign/view.php?id=3646202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assignment</a></p>',24)]))}const p=e(s,[["render",r],["__file","Assignment2.1.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/study/unisa/2024(LastSemester)/CustomerAnalyticsinLargeOrganisations/Assignment2.1.html","title":"Assignment 2 – Credit Scoring","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Assignment 2 – Credit Scoring","index":true,"icon":"circle-dot","author":"Haiyue","date":"2024-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","category":["unisa"],"feed":false,"seo":false,"gitInclude":[],"head":[]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Dataset","slug":"dataset","link":"#dataset","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Research questions","slug":"research-questions","link":"#research-questions","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Submission","slug":"submission","link":"#submission","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Software","slug":"software","link":"#software","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Data description","slug":"data-description","link":"#data-description","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Reference","slug":"reference","link":"#reference","children":[]}],"readingTime":{"minutes":4.55,"words":1364},"filePathRelative":"study/unisa/2024(LastSemester)/CustomerAnalyticsinLargeOrganisations/Assignment2.1.md","localizedDate":"May 16, 2024"}');export{p as comp,h as data};
