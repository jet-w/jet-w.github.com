This documentation will outline the <span style="color:orange;">underlying methodologies, algorithms, and techniques</span> employed in the text summarisation tool.</li><li><strong>Codebase and Integration Guidelines</strong><br> In addition to the prototype and documentation, a well-organised and commented codebase will be provided. The codebase will contain the necessary code files, libraries, and resources required to build and run the text summarisation tool. The codebase follows best practice in software development, ensuring modularity, scalability, and maintainability.</li><li><strong>Preparation of Scientific Publication</strong> [OPTIONAL]<br> As an additional deliverable, there is an option to prepare a scientific publication based on the findings, methodologies, and outcomes of the pilot study. The publication would aim to contribute to the academic community and industry knowledge by sharing insights, best practices, and potential advancements in the field of text summarisation across various domains, including case management and lifelong learning. This optional deliverable would involve collaborating with researchers and subject matter experts from both Genix Ventures and C3L to draft, refine, and submit the scientific publication to relevant conferences or journals. The decision to pursue this deliverable will depend on the significance of the study&#39;s outcomes and the interest of both teams in sharing their findings with the broader research community.</li></ol>',2),r=[a];function s(l,d){return t(),o("div",null,r)}const h=e(n,[["render",s],["__file","ProjectInfo.html.vue"]]);export{h as default};
