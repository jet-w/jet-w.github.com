This exercise is worth <span style="color:orange;">10 points</span> of your final grade.<br> You will design an experiment, collect data, run data analysis, and prepare a report. Please consider a scenario that you want to get a better understanding of students’ experiences and perceptions towards dining-out. You run research about students’ preferences and factors important for students while choosing between different options of dining-out.<br> Here are some factors and levels that might be of interest:</p><ol><li><strong>Type of cuisine:</strong> Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian, Japanese, Fast food (like, McDonalds or KFC), Burger place.</li><li><strong>Delivery mode:</strong> Dining-in, Take-away delivered to your home, Take-away picked-up yourself.</li><li><strong>Locations:</strong> can reach by foot, short drive, long drive.</li><li><strong>Place:</strong> fancy restaurant, café, food court, small take-away place, street van.</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> food will be ready in 15 minutes, ready in half-hour, ready in an hour.</li><li><strong>Ownership:</strong> multinational chain (McDonalds, KFC, Domino’s), Australian chain (Red Rooster, Zambrero), local place.</li><li><strong>Price per meal for two:</strong> $20; $40; $60; $100. You can add “without drinks”.</li><li><strong>Whatever you can think about.</strong></li></ol><p>Also, you might consider some demographic information questions:</p><ol><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female; Male; Prefer not to tell.</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> up to 20; 21-30; 31-40; 41-50; more than 50.</li><li><strong>Student:</strong> international; domestic.</li><li><strong>Country of origin.</strong></li><li><strong>Whatever</strong> you believe might be relevant to the decision about selecting dining-out.</li></ol><p>You don’t need to use all suggested factors or all suggested levels. This is simply impossible as there would be too many options. You select <span style="color:orange;">only some factors</span>, and then some levels within these factors. You are welcome to introduce your own factors and/or levels.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong> online survey provider might have a limit for a number of questions per survey for free accounts. Also, your respondents might get very tired if there are too many questions. Try to construct an experiment that you can fit into 10-12 questions.<br><span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">Important:</span> online survey provider limits time when you can download your results by 14 days from the day you created the survey. Act accordingly.</p><hr><p>For this exercise, you should complete the following tasks:</p>',9),c=e("li",null,"Select a set of factors/levels and design a discrete choice experiment with approximately 10 questions in total.

Getting my confirmation concludes your “link submission” part. If you don’t get response from me within several hours – <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">you should contact me again</span>.</p><p>For the “real” assessment submission you must <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">submit one file</span> with your report in <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">MS Word or PDF format</span>. <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">Report should be brief</span> as this is a small exercise only. <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">Couple pages</span> including <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">tables with the results</span> should be sufficient. There is <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">no formal limit</span> on words/pages in the report. It can be as short or as long as you believe it is necessary. If your report is too long but meaningful, useful, and interesting to read, then there will be no deductions. However, if your report is too long due to meaningless and/or generic blah-blah-blah, then there will be <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">deductions</span>.</p><p>You don’t need to submit programming code; however, you should retain copies of all computer files used during development of the solution to the assessment. These files must remain unchanged after report submission, for the purpose of checking if required.</p><p><span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">Reminder:</span> There is a time gap between creating the survey and analysing results. You need to have a design file for the analysis.
