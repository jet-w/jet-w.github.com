Go bananas with optimisation</h2><p>You are a fresh produce manager in the supermarket. Use historical data provided in the Excel-file “Q3_Bananas.xlsx” to choose optimal solutions for buying bananas for the supermarket for the two scenarios below:</p><ol><li>You are a greedy manager, and you want to earn as much money as possible.</li><li>You are an environmentally minded manager, and you want to reduce the bananas wastage less than 1% per year of your total amount of bought bananas.</li></ol><p>The Excel file has three columns:</p><ol><li><strong>Date</strong> of sales. It is not important for this problem.</li><li><strong>Demand</strong> for bananas. This is a random variable, and you don’t know it when you make your decision about buying banana stock for your supermarket. Later you use it to calculate your profit or loss. For example, if demand is 400 kg, while your stock is 300 kg only, then you are able to sell all bananas, and part of the demand is not satisfied; however, if stock is 500 kg, then you sell 400 kg, the full demand is satisfied, but 100 kg of bananas are wasted. <span style="color:orange;">We assume, that bananas cannot be stored and should be sold on the next day. Unsold bananas go to waste.</span></li><li><strong>Price</strong> is a selling price of bananas in the supermarket on a given day. The supermarket does not set their own prices. The supermarket follows the wholesale market and sells bananas with a fixed 25% margin. That, if the listed selling price for today is $1.25 then the cost of buying bananas on that day is $1, and the supermarket profit is 25 cents ($0.25) per one kilogram of bananas. Beware, cost is always 25% less than selling price.</li></ol><p>As you know, demand has a negative relationship with the price – if price goes up, demand goes down, people don’t buy that much if the price is too high. Hence, as a smart manager, you are interested in a “flexible” solution where the quantity you buy varies from day to day and depends on the price.</p><h2 id="_4-optimisation-for-a-life-of-crime" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-optimisation-for-a-life-of-crime" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4.

Also, the number of buyers is a random variable, so you cannot be sure how many tickets you will be able to sell.</p><p>The number of tickets you can sell (demand) follows <span style="color:orange;">lognormal distribution</span> with <span style="color:orange;">mean µ and standard deviation = 0.5</span>.</p><div class="hint-container note"><p class="hint-container-title">Note</p><p>The number of tickets sold will be not an integer, which does not make sense.
