As any newlywed couple knows, there is a huge amount of financial pressure associated with marriage. Firstly, the wedding reception and honeymoon will cost you an arm and a leg. Then there&#39;s the matter of home loans, rent and energy bills. If you&#39;re looking to start a family, your child&#39;s education is another thing you need to save up for.

His social relations are difficult as he cannot find the right phrase quickly enough to keep a conversation going, so his language often betrays him into dullness, coldness, or worst of all, rudeness.
