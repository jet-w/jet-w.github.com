Each section focus on different perspective of the plan. I will describe each of them.</p><h2 id="section-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1"><span>Section 1</span></a></h2><p>The first part is <code>Project Background and Description</code>. This section focus on answering several questions related with our plan, which will clarify the key points of the project.</p><p>These questions are advanced step by step based on the analysis of the project step by step.</p><ul><li>The first question is <code>&quot;What the subject are we working on?â€‹&quot;</code> in other words the question could also be <code>&quot;what&#39;s the main task of the project?&quot;</code></li></ul><p>The answer is LoD Analysis for BIM data cooperate with John Boland.</p><hr><p>We can extract two key points from the answer, which are BIM, LoD.</p><p>The following two questions are what are them?<br> The fullname of BIM is Building Information Modeling, which is a digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility. Simple words it&#39;s using a 3D model come up with metadata to represent infrastructure.</p><p>For LoD, we need to clarify two questions, first is LoD, another one is LoD analysis.<br> The fullname of LoD is Level of Development or Level of Details. It defines the level of a 3D model. Each 3D model development need to follow some spec defined by the specification organization BIM Forum.</p><p>LoD analysis is to identify the Level of model based the specification files. The process can be broken down into two steps.<br> Step 1: Identify the spec from the specification file for a 3D model.<br> Step 2: Identify the level of the 3D model based on the level requirements.</p><hr><p>The current approach taken by them is to do all the steps manually. It can lead to human error and also it&#39;s inefficient.</p><p>What we need to do is construct a automatice process to overcome the drawbacks of the manual approach.</p><hr><p>We split the whole project into 3 modules, which are data preprocessing, LoD analysis and UI parts.</p><ul><li>The data preprocessing mainly focus on converting the specification data to a structured data.</li><li>The LoD analysis is find a pattern to map an object to a specified LoD.</li><li>The UI part is to integrate all other parts as the final visualization, it will be easier to use for end user.</li></ul><hr><p>Finally, it&#39;s obviously that the deliverables should include the structured data, Mapping patttern, and the UI.</p><h2 id="section-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2"><span>Section 2</span></a></h2><p>The next section is Project Scope. The section includes two parts, which are inclusions and exclusions.</p><p>The inclusions are the tasks has been broken down that we need to do during the following weeks. The exclusions are the tasks that we does not to do.</p><h2 id="section-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3"><span>Section 3</span></a></h2><p>The third section is Risks that we perhaps will come across. All the risks are mainly about the techniques difficulties. After the analysis of our team, we got 7 risks, 2 high level, 3 midlle level and 2 low level.</p><h2 id="section-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4"><span>Section 4</span></a></h2><p>The fourth section is the budget, this is a student team there is no real cost, we calculate using the time consuming to get the budget. The team time consuming during the 13 weeks is about 1040 hours.</p><h2 id="section-5" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5"><span>Section 5</span></a></h2><p>The fifth section is roles and responsibilities, this section includes 3 parts, which are team members responsiblities, communications plan and project stakeholders.</p><p>My responsibilities will focus on the spec preprocessing and LoD analysis.</p><p>This table lists our communication plan. This table lists all the project stakeholders.</p><h2 id="section-6" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6"><span>Section 6</span></a></h2><p>The sixth section include the deliverables and evaluation criteria.<br> The deliverables comprise</p><ol><li>Final Report</li><li>Packaging solution</li><li>Presentation</li></ol><p>The evaluation criteria is some criterias that we need to use to evaluate our final deliverables.</p><h2 id="section-7" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7"><span>Section 7</span></a></h2><p>The seventh section is the implementation plan.<br> We defined 7 phase to implement the project, all the items are listed in the slide.</p><ol><li>Initiation phase, is to finish the project plan.</li><li>Research Phase is to do literature review to find some available methods for LoD analysis.</li><li>Data Collection and preprocessing phase focus on preprocess the data.<br> Phase 4 and 5 focus how to map the model to a LoD.<br> Phase 6 focus on implementing the UI parts.<br> The final parts will finetuning work and documents work.</li></ol><h2 id="section-8" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8"><span>Section 8</span></a></h2><p>The final section define the timeline for each phase.<br> Such as, phase 1 &amp; 2 take 1 week each; phase 3 takes 3 weeks, etc.</p><p>It&#39;s all my presentation.
