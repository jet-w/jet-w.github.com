At least, that was the belief of French social historian Philippe Aries, who in the 1960s put forward the startling proposal that childhood was a relatively recent invention. According to Aries and his disciples, children in the Middle Ages were considered mini-adults, no cuter or more fragile than the full-sized version, and therefore deserving of no special treatment. Not until the 17th and 18th centuries were they recognized as <span style="color:orange;">endearing</span> little creatures in need of <span style="color:orange;">nurturing</span> and protection. Harvard University professor Steven Ozment presents a very different picture in his 2001 book Ancestors Marshaling evidence ranging from legal records to private letters, Ozment argues persuasively that men and women throughout history have <span style="color:orange;">cherished</span> their <span style="color:orange;">offspring</span>. But there&#39;s no doubt we are <span style="color:orange;">clingier</span> than we used to be.&quot;In 18th century Western Europe, wealthy families <span style="color:orange;">routinely</span> sent their <span style="color:orange;">infants</span> away to be raised by <span style="color:orange;">wet nurses</span> for the first several years of their lives. Well, into the 20th century, British couples who could afford to do so opted out of day-to-day childrearing altogether, gladly handing their kids to <span style="color:orange;">nannies</span> and boarding schools.&quot;</p><ul><li>endearing adjective UK /ɪnˈdɪə.rɪŋ/ US /ɪnˈdɪr.ɪŋ/ making someone like you</li><li>nurturing verb [ T ] UK /ˈnɜː.tʃər/ US /ˈnɝː.tʃɚ/ to take care of, feed, and protect someone or something, especially young children or plants, and help him, her, or it to develop</li><li>cherished adjective US /ˈtʃer·ɪʃt/ bringing the pleasure of love or caring about someone or something that is important to you</li><li>offspring noun [ C ] UK /ˈɒf.sprɪŋ/ US /ˈɑːf.sprɪŋ/ the young of an animal / a person&#39;s children</li><li>clingier</li><li>clingy adjective UK /ˈklɪŋ.i/ US /ˈklɪŋ.i/ used to describe something that sticks onto someone or something tightly</li><li>routinely adverb UK /ruːˈtiːn.li/ US /ruːˈtiːn.li/ used for describing what often or usually happen</li><li>infant noun UK /ˈɪn.fənt/ US /ˈɪn.fənt/ a baby or a very young child</li><li>nanny noun [ C ] UK /ˈnæn.i/ US /ˈnæn.i/ a person whose job is to take care of a particular family&#39;s children</li></ul><h2 id="instant-noodles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#instant-noodles" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Instant noodles</h2><p>In 1958 instant noodles went on the market, yellowish wormy bricks in cellophane bags, and were laughed at by fresh-noodle makers all over Japan. They were just a high-tech craze, costing six times as much as the fresh stuff; they would never catch on. By the end of the first year, Momofuku Ando had sold 13m bags and had attracted a dozen competitors. He never looked back. The Japanese voted instant noodles their most important 20th century invention, Sony Walkmans notwithstanding.

We are told that the United States is the only superpower in a unipolar world. But the situation is far more complex than first meets the eye. The agenda of world politics has become like a three-dimensional chess game in which one can win only by playing vertically as well as horizontally. On the top board of classic interstate military issues, the United States is indeed the only superpower with global military reach, and it makes sense to speak in traditional terms of unipolarity or hegemony. However, on the middle board of interstate economic issues, the distribution of power is multipolar. The United States cannot obtain the outcomes it wants on trade, antitrust, or financial regulation issues without the agreement of the European Union, Japan, China and others. It makes little sense to call this American hegemony, and on the bottom board of transnational issues like terrorism, international crime, climate change, and the spread of infectious diseases, power is widely distributed and chaotically organized among state and non-state actors.

Almost seven times more forested federal land burned during the 1987 2003 period than during the prior 17 years. In addition, large fires occurred about four times more often during the latter period. The research is the most systematic analysis to date of recent changes in forest fire activity in the western United States. The increases in fire extent and frequency are strongly linked to higher March-through-August temperatures and are most pronounced for mid-elevation forests in the northern Rocky Mountains. The new finding points to climate change, not fire suppression policies and forest fuel accumulation, as the primary driver of recent increases in large forest fires.</p><h2 id="dennett" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dennett" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dennett</h2><p>Dennett recognizes that all human minds are shaped not only by natural selection but by enormous cultural influenced which effectively redesign our minds. He invites us to think of the conscious mind as consisting of those mental contents that win in competition against other mental contents in the battle for control of behavior. What we are is the organization of all the competitive activity between a host of competences that our bodies have developed. Consciousness is defined by what a mind can do whether it can concentrate, be distracted, recall earlier events, keep track of a number of things at once etc. Dennett urges us to resist the temptation to imagine animals as accompanying their clever activities with streams of reflective consciousness as we would. We may not know that they do not, but we certainly cannot assume that they do. He notes that the more we learn about clever activities in animals and how they are accomplished, the less the processes in their brains seem to resemble the thoughts we imagined were doing the work.</p><ul><li>conscious adjective UK /ˈkɒn.ʃəs/ US /ˈkɑːn.ʃəs/ <ul><li>conscious adjective (NOTICING) to notice that a particular thing or person exists or is present</li><li>conscious adjective (AWAKE) awake, thinking, and knowing what is happening around you</li><li>conscious adjective (INTENTIONAL) determined and intentional</li><li>conscious adjective (AWAKE) awake, aware of what is happening around you, and able to think</li><li>conscious adjective (NOTICING) noticing the existence of something</li></ul></li><li>competences noun [ C or U ] UK /ˈkɒm.pɪ.təns/ US /ˈkɑːm.pə.t̬əns/ <ul><li>the ability to do something well</li><li>an important skill that is needed to do a job</li><li>the power of a person, business, court, or government to deal with something or take legal decisions</li></ul></li><li>consciousness noun [ U ] UK /ˈkɒn.ʃəs.nəs/ US /ˈkɑːn.ʃəs.nəs/ <ul><li>the state of understanding and realizing something</li><li>the state of being awake, thinking, and knowing what is happening around you</li></ul></li><li>temptation noun UK /tempˈteɪ.ʃən/ US /tempˈteɪ.ʃən/ <ul><li>the wish to do or have something that you know you should not do or have</li><li>something that makes you want to do or have something that you know you should not</li><li>the desire to have or do something, esp. something wrong, or something that causes this desire</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="_3d-printing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3d-printing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3D Printing</h2><p>With the help of their latest invention in science a 3D printer, researchers managed to create the exact copy of a man&#39;s thumb bones. The device can now be used to help surgeons restore damaged bones by creating their precise copies, which are made from the patient&#39;s cells. The new method implies a number of steps. Initially, it is important to have a 3D image of the bone that is going to be copied. In case the bone has been damaged, one can create a mirror image of the bone&#39;s intact twin. Afterwards the picture of the bone is inserted into a 3D inject printer that puts thin layers of a material( selected beforehand) on top of one another till the 3D object shows up. After successfully replicating a bone, the copy itself features small pores on its&quot;scaffolds&quot;. This is where bone cells can eventually settle, grow and then completely displace the biodegradable scaffold. Scientists removed CD117 cells from bone marrow that remained after hip-replacement surgical operations. These cells develop into primordial bone cells, also known as osteoblasts. The latter were syringed on top of the bone scaffolds in a gel that was created to nourish the CD117 cells as well as support them. In the final step, scientists sew scaffolds under the skin on the backs of laboratory mice. After 15 weeks the scaffold had turned into human bone.</p><ul><li>intact adjective UK /ɪnˈtækt/ US /ɪnˈtækt/ complete and in the original state</li><li>pores noun [ C ] UK /pɔːr/ /pɔːr/ a very small hole in the skin of people or other animals, or a similar hole on the surface of plants or rocks</li><li>marrow noun UK /ˈmær.əʊ/ US /ˈmer.oʊ/ soft tissue containing a lot of fat in the centre of a bone</li><li>primordial adjective formal UK /praɪˈmɔː.di.əl/ US /praɪˈmɔːr.di.əl/ existing at or since the beginning of the world or the universe</li><li>osteoblasts noun [ C ] ANATOMY specialized UK/ˈɒs.ti.əʊ.blɑːst/ US/ˈɑː.sti.oʊ.blæst/ a cell that forms bone</li><li>syringed noun [ C ] UK /sɪˈrɪndʒ/ US /səˈrɪndʒ/ a hollow, cylinder-shaped piece of equipment used for sucking liquid out of something or pushing liquid into something, especially one with a needle that can be put under the skin and used to inject drugs, remove small amounts of blood, etc.</li><li>gel noun UK /dʒel/ US /dʒel/a thick, clear, liquid substance, especially one used on the hair or body</li><li>nourish nourish verb [ T ] UK /ˈnʌr.ɪʃ/ US /ˈnɝː.ɪʃ/ to provide people or living things with food in order to make them grow and keep them healthy</li></ul><h2 id="snow-slide" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#snow-slide" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Snow Slide</h2><p>Now, Osvanny Ramos of the Ecole Normale Suprieure in Lyon, France, and colleagues say prediction is possible after all. They designed an experiment that induced avalanches in a two-dimensional pile of 4 millimetre-diameter steel beads. They placed a 60 centimetre row of randomly spaced beads between two parallel, vertical glass plates 4.5 millimetres apart, with the beads glued to the bottom to simulate the ground under a natural pile. Then they dropped in one bead at a time, creating piles of up to 55, 000 beads. After each drop, the team photographed the pile and measured the position of each bead to calculate the&quot;space factor&quot; a measure of the disorder in the system, which was related to the space surrounding each bead( see diagram). The greater the disorder round a bead, the more likely an avalanche was. If one or more beads moved when a new bead fell on the pile, that was considered to be an avalanche. An extra-large avalanche involved between 317 and 1000 beads. The researchers found that if the space factor before a bead dropped was greater than it had been 50 steps earlier, they could predict an extra-large avalanche with 64 percent accuracy. Ramos says that they can improve the odds by analysing more information, such as the size of the pile( Physical Review Letters, vol 102, p 078701). The work could also have important consequences for predicting earthquakes. Ramos has an inkling why forecasting earthquakes is so difficult: seismologist tend to use information about the time and size of events, known as a time series. However, Ramos found that this didn&#39;t help predict the next big avalanche.&quot;When seismologists try to predict earthquakes, they analyse the time series,&quot; he says. He argues that they would have more success analysing data analogous to the internal disorder in the pile of beads.</p><ul><li>avalanches noun [ C ] UK /ˈæv.əl.ɑːntʃ/ US /ˈæv.əl.æntʃ/ <ul><li>a large amount of ice, snow, and rock falling quickly down the side of a mountain</li><li>too many things that arrive or happen at the same time</li></ul></li><li>bead noun [ C ] UK /biːd/ US /biːd/ <ul><li>bead noun [C] (JEWELLERY) a small, coloured, often round piece of plastic, wood, glass, etc. with a hole through it.

Although the Australian Government provided regular funding for universities from the late 1950s, in 1974, it assumed full responsibility for funding higher education abolishing tuition fees with the intention of making university accepted to all Australians who had the ability and who wished to participate in higher education. Since the late 1980s, there has been a move towards greater private contributions, particularly students fees. In 1989, the Australian Government introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme( HECS) which included a loans scheme to help students finance their contributions. This enabled universities to remain accessible to students by delaying their payments until they could afford to pay off their loans. In 2002, the Australian Government introduced a scheme similar to HECS for postgraduate students the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme( PELS).</p><ul><li>abolish verb [ T ] UK /əˈbɒl.ɪʃ/ US /əˈbɑː.lɪʃ/ to end an activity or custom officially</li></ul><h2 id="carbon-detox" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#carbon-detox" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Carbon Detox</h2><p>In his fascinating book Carbon Detox, George Marshall argues that people are not persuaded by information. Our views are formed by the views of the people with whom we mix. Of the narratives that might penetrate these circles, we are more likely to listen to those that offer us some reward. A story that tells us that the world is cooking and that we&#39;ll have to make sacrifices for the sake of future generations is less likely to be accepted than the more rewarding idea that climate change is a conspiracy hatched by scheming governments and venal scientists, and that strong, independent-minded people should unite to defend their freedoms. He proposes that instead of arguing for sacrifice, environmentalists should show where the rewards might lie: that understanding what the science is saying and planning accordingly is the smart thing to do, which will protect your interests more effectively than flinging abuse at scientists. We should emphasize the old-fashioned virtues of uniting in the face of a crisis, of resourcefulness and community action.
