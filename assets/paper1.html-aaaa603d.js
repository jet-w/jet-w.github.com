Learning diagnosis aims to promote students’ learning according to diagnostic results which typically including diagnostic feedback and interventions. However, most existing cross-sectional learning diagnoses are not concerned about measuring growth in learning. By contrast, longitudinal learning diagnosis evaluates students’ knowledge and skills (collectively known as latent attributes) and identifies their strengths and weaknesses over a period <em>(Zhan, 2020b)</em>.</p><p>A complete longitudinal learning diagnosis should include at least two parts: an instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis of specific content and <span style="color:orange;">a longitudinal learning diagnosis model (LDM)</span>. The precondition of the measurement of longitudinal learning is a high-quality instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis. The data collected from the instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis can provide researchers with opportunities to develop longitudinal <span style="color:orange;">LDMs</span> that can be used to <span style="color:orange;">track individual growth over time</span>. Additionally, in recent years, several longitudinal LDMs have been proposed, for review, see Zhan (2020a). Although the usefulness of these longitudinal LDMs in analyzing longitudinal learning diagnosis data has been evaluated through some simulation studies and a few applications, the development process of an instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis is rarely mentioned (cf. Wang et al., 2020). The lack of an operable development process of instrument hinders the application and promotion of longitudinal learning diagnosis in practice and prevents practitioners from specific fields to apply this approach to <span style="color:orange;">track individual growth in specific domains</span>.</p><p>Currently, there are many applications use cross-sectional LDMs to diagnose individuals’ learning status in the field of mathematics because the structure of mathematical attributes is relative clear to be identified, such as <span style="color:orange;">fraction calculations</span> (Tatsuoka, 1983; Wu, 2019), <span style="color:orange;">linear algebraic equations</span> (Birenbaum et al., 1993), and <span style="color:orange;">spatial rotations</span> (Chen et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). Some studies also apply cross-sectional LDMs to analyze data from large-scale mathematical assessments (e.g., George and Robitzsch, 2018; Park et al., 2018; Zhan et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020). However, most of these application studies use cross-sectional design and <span style="color:orange;">cannot track the individual growth of mathematical ability</span>.</p><p>In the field of mathematics, understanding rational numbers is crucial for students’ mathematics achievement (Booth et al., 2014). Rational numbers and their operations are one of the most basic concepts of numbers and mathematical operations, respectively. The fact that many effects are put into rational number teaching makes many students and teachers struggle to understand rational numbers (Cramer et al., 2002; Mazzocco and Devlin, 2008). The content of rational number operation is the first challenge that students encounter in the field of mathematics at the beginning of junior high school. Learning rational number operation is not only the premise of the subsequent learning of mathematics in junior high school but is also an important opportunity to cultivate students’ interest and confidence in mathematics learning.</p><p>The main purpose of this study is to develop an instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis, especially for the content of rational number operations. We present the development process step by step to provide a reference for practitioners to develop the instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis.</p><h2 id="development-of-the-instrument-for-longitudinal-learning-diagnosis" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#development-of-the-instrument-for-longitudinal-learning-diagnosis" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Development of the Instrument for Longitudinal Learning Diagnosis</h2><p>As the repeated measures design is not always feasible in longitudinal educational measurement, in this study, the developed instrument is a longitudinal assessment consisting of parallel tests. The whole development process is shown in <em><strong>Figure 1</strong></em>. In the rest of the paper, we describe the development process step by step.</p><figure><img src="'+c+'" alt="Figure 1.

In the analysis of previous studies, <span style="color:orange;">the confirmation of attributes</span> mainly adopted the method of literature review (Henson and Douglas, 2005) and expert judgment (Buck et al., 1997; Roduta Roberts et al., 2014; Wu, 2019). This study used the combination of these two methods.</p><p>First, relevant content knowledge was extracted according to the analysis of mathematics curriculum standards, mathematics exam outlines, teaching materials and supporting books, existing provincial tests, and chapter exercises. By reviewing the literature, we find that the existing researches mainly focus on one or several parts of rational number operation. For example, fraction addition and subtraction is the most involved in existing researches (e.g., Tatsuoka, 1983; Wu, 2019). In contrast, it is not common to focus on the whole part of rational number operation in diagnostic tests. Ning et al. (2012) pointed out that rational number operation contains 15 attributes; however, such a larger number of attributes does not apply in practice.</p><p>Second, according to the attribute framework based on the diagnosis of mathematics learning among students in 20 countries in the Third International Math and Science Study–Revised (Tatsuoka et al., 2004), the initial attribute framework and the corresponding attribute hierarchy (Leighton et al., 2004) of this study <span style="color:orange;">were determined after a discussion among six experts</span>, including <span style="color:orange;">two frontline mathematics teachers</span> who have more than 10 years’ experience in mathematics education, <span style="color:orange;">two graduate students</span> majoring in mathematics, and <span style="color:orange;">two graduate students</span> majoring in psychometrics (see Table 1 and Figure 2).</p><table><thead><tr><th>Label</th><th>Attribute</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A1</td><td>Rational number</td><td>Concepts and classifications</td></tr><tr><td>A2</td><td>Related concepts of the rational number</td><td>Opposite number, absolute value.</td></tr><tr><td>A3</td><td>Number Axis</td><td>Concept, number conversion, comparison of the size of numbers.</td></tr><tr><td>A4</td><td>Addition and subtraction of rational numbers</td><td>Addition, subtraction, and addition operation rules.</td></tr><tr><td>A5</td><td>Multiplication and division of rational numbers</td><td>Multiplication, involution, multiplication operation rule, division and reciprocat.

All experts agreed that the attributes and their hierarchical relationships were reasonable. In the think-aloud protocol analysis, six items were initially prepared according to the initial attribute framework and attribute hierarchy <em>(see Table 2)</em>. Then, six seventh graders were selected according to above-average performance, gender balance, willingness to participate, and ability to express their thinking process (Gierl et al., 2008). The experimenter individually tested these students and recorded their responses; in the response process, the students were required to say aloud their problem-solving train of thought. Taking the responses of two students to item 6 as an example, Figure 3 and Table 3 present their problem-solving process and thinking process, respectively. Although different students used different problem-solving processes, they all used addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve the items of the mixed operation of rational numbers. Therefore, mastering A4 and A5 are prerequisites to mastering A6, and they validate the rationality of the attribute hierarchy proposed by experts.</p>',21),C=e("div",{style:{display:"flex"}},[e("div",{style:{flex:"2"}},[e("figure",null,[e("img",{src:p,alt:"Table 2.

Therefore, the attribute patterns that contain A6 but lack either A4 or A5 are unattainable. Theoretically, there are 40 rather than 26 = 64 attainable attribute patterns. Correspondingly, the initial Q-matrix (i.e., test blueprint) (Tatsuoka, 1983) was constructed based on these 40 permissible attribute patterns and with the following factors in mind: (a) the Q-matrix contains at least one reachability matrix for completeness (Ding et al., 2010); (b) each attribute is examined at least twice, and (c) the test time is limited to a teaching period of 40 min to ensure that students have a high degree of involvement. Finally, the test length was determined as 18, including 12 multiple-choice items and 6 calculation items (see Figure 4). Notice that all items are dichotomous scored in current study. To ensure that the initial item bank contains enough items, we prepared 4–5 items for each of the 18 attribute patterns contained in the initial Q-matrix.

In general, a high-quality test should have the following characteristics: (a) the average difficulty of the test is 0.5, (b) the difficulty of each item is between 0.2 and 0.8, and (c) the discrimination of each item is greater than 0.3.

In the preliminary tests, the Mantel-Haenszel method (Holland and Thayer, 1986) was used to conduct DIF testing. Male is treated as the reference group, and female is treated as the focal group.

Thus, empirical validation of the initial Q-matrix was still needed to improve the accuracy of subsequent analysis (de la Torre, 2008). Although item quality was controlled in the preliminary test, it was necessary to ensure that these three tests, as instruments for longitudinal learning diagnosis, met the requirements of parallel tests.

Including the model–data fitting, the empirical validation of the initial Q-matrix, the model parameter estimation, and the testing of reliability and validity were conducted. In the parallel test checking, the consistency of the three tests among the raw scores, the estimated item parameters, and the diagnostic classifications were calculated.</p></li></ul><p>The deterministic-input, noisy “and” (DINA) model (Junker and Sijtsma, 2001), the deterministic-input, noisy “or” (DINO) model (Templin and Henson, 2006), and the general DINA (GDINA) model (de la Torre, 2011) were used to fit the data. In the model–data fitting, as suggested by Chen et al. (2013), the AIC and BIC were used for the relative fit evaluation, and the RMSEA, SRMSR, MADcor, and MADQ3 were used for the absolute fit evaluation. In the model parameter estimation, only the estimates of the best-fitting model were presented. In the empirical validation of the initial Q-matrix, the procedure suggested by de la Torre (2008) was used. In the model-based DIF checking, the Wald test (Hou et al., 2014) was used. In the testing of reliability and validity, the classification accuracy (Pa) and consistency (Pc) indices (Wang et al., 2015) were computed.</p><ul><li>Results<br> Descriptive statistics of raw scores<br> A total of 301 students took the formal test.

Table 8 presents the descriptive statistics of raw scores in the formal tests. The average, standard deviation, mode, median, minimum, and maximum of raw scores of the three tests were the same.</li></ul><figure><img src="'+w+'" alt="Table 8.

Descriptive statistics of raw scores in the formal tests.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Model–data fitting<br> The parameters in an LDM can be interpreted only when the selected model fits the data. The fit indices presented in Table 9 provide information about the data fit of three LDMs, namely DINA, DINO, and GDINA, to determine the best-fitting model. Absolute fit indices hold that values near zero indicate an absolute fit (Oliveri and von Davier, 2011; Ravand, 2016). The result indices indicated that all three models fitted the data well. For relative fit indices, smaller values indicate a better fit. The DINA model was preferred based on the BIC, and the GDINA model was preferred based on the AIC. According to the parsimony principle (Beck, 1943), a simpler model is preferred if its performance is not significantly worse than that of a more complex model. Both AIC and BIC introduced a penalty for model complexity. However, as the sample size was included in the penalty in BIC, the penalty in BIC was larger than that in AIC. The DINA model was chosen as the best-fitting model given the small sample size of this study, which might not meet the needs of an accurate parameter estimation of the GDINA model, and the item parameters in the DINA model having more straightforward interpretations. Therefore, the DINA model was used for the follow-up model-based analyses.</li></ul><figure><img src="'+x+'" alt="Table 9.

Notice that the Q-matrix validation can also be skipped when the model fits the data well. Table 10 presents the revision suggestion based on the empirical validation of the initial Q-matrix. In all three tests, the revision suggestion was only for item 9. However, after the subjective and empirical judgment of the experts (Ravand, 2016), this revision suggestion was not recommended to be adopted. Let us take item 9 (“Which number minus 7 is equal to −10?”) in formal test A as an example. Clearly, this item does not address the suggested changes in A3, A5, and A6. As the expert-defined Q-matrix was consistent with the data-driven Q-matrix, the initial Q-matrix was used as the confirmed Q-matrix in the follow-up analyses.</li></ul><figure><img src="'+A+'" alt="Table 10.

According to Ravand and Robitzsch (2018), values of at least 0.8 for the Pa index and 0.7 for the Pc index can be considered acceptable classification rates. As shown in Table 11, both pattern- and attribute-level classification accuracy and consistency were within the acceptable range. Additionally, Cronbach’s α, split-half reliability, and parallel form reliability were also computed based on the raw scores (see Table 12). The attribute framework of this study was reassessed by several experts, and the Q-matrix was confirmed, indicating that the content validity and the structural validity of this study were good. To further verify the external validity, the correlation between the raw score of each formal test and the raw score of a monthly exam (denoted as S; the content of this test is the chapter on “rational numbers”) was computed (rAS = 0.95, p &lt; 0.01; rBS = 0.95, p &lt; 0.01; rCS = 0.94, p &lt; 0.01).

In order to provide a reference for practitioners to develop the instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis, the development process was presented step by step. The development process contains three main phases, the Q-matrix construction and item development, the preliminary test for item quality monitoring, and the formal test for test quality control. The results of this study indicate that (a) both the overall quality of the tests and the quality of each item are good enough and that (b) the three tests meet the requirements of parallel tests, which can be used as an instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis to track students’ learning.</p><p>However, there are still some limitations of this study. First, to increase operability, only the binary attributes were adopted. As the binary attribute can only divide students into two categories (i.e., mastery and non-mastery), it may not meet the need for a multiple levels division of practical teaching objectives (Bloom et al., 1956). Polytomous attributes and the corresponding LDMs (Karelitz, 2008; Zhan et al., 2020) can be adopted in future studies. Second, the adopted instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis was based on parallel tests. However, in practice, perfect parallel tests do not exist. In further studies, the anchor-item design (e.g., Zhan et al., 2019) can be adopted to develop an instrument for longitudinal learning diagnosis. Third, an appropriate Q-matrix is one of the key factors in learning diagnosis (de la Torre, 2008). However, the Q-matrix used in the instrument may not strictly meet the requirements of identification (Gu and Xu, 2019), which may affect the diagnostic classification accuracy.</p>',31);function B(R,Q){const a=n("ExternalLinkIcon");return l(),r("div",null,[e("p",null,[t("This article is copy the "),e("a",_,[t("Paper"),o(a)]),t(" content and make some notes for better understanding.")]),M,C,F,q])}const P=i(D,[["render",B],["__file","paper1.html.vue"]]);export{P as default};
