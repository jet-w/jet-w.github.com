However, existing work on HTE, subgroup discovery, and causal visualization is insufficient to address two challenges: <span style="color:orange;">first, the sheer number of potential subgroups and the necessity to balance multiple objectives (e.g.., high effects and low variances) pose a considerable analytical challenge</span>. <span style="color:orange;">Second, effective subgroup analysis has to follow the analysis goal specified by users and provide causal results with verification</span>. To this end, <span style="color:orange;">we propose a visual analytics approach for subgroup-based causal heterogeneity exploration</span>. Specifically, we first formulate causal subgroup discovery as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem and adopt a heuristic genetic algorithm to learn the Pareto front of optimal subgroups described by interpretable rules. Combining with this model, we develop a prototype system, <em>CausalPrism</em>, that incorporates tabular visualization, multi-attribute rankings, and uncertainty plots to support users in interactively exploring and sorting subgroups and explaining treatment effects. Quantitative experiments validate that the proposed model can efficiently mine causal subgroups that outperform state-of-the-art HTE and subgroup discovery methods, and case studies and expert interviews demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of the system.

As shown in Fig. 1, subgroups within the population responded differently to the treatment. The treatment exerts larger effects on Subgroup 1 and Subgroup 3 than Subgroup 2. Nevertheless, the high variance of Subgroup 1 indicates that individual differences (uncertainty of the outcome) exist. Discovering those subgroups with strong treatment effect and low outcome variance (hereinafter referred to as significant treatment effect) compared to the overall population is widely used in domains such as healthcare [50], marketing [56], and public administration [23]. For example, marketers want to find customer groups where advertising more effectively drives purchases. Since Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), known as the gold standard for causal inference [31], are not always feasible due to cost or ethical concerns, there is a strong need to uncover those causal subgroups from observational data effectively.<br><img src="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.01893v1/extracted/5701631/figs/toy-example.png" alt="Figure 1:An illustrative toy example.

Subgroups can be described by different combinations of variables, which could lead to a combinatorial explosion of candidates. Selecting optimal subgroups requires trade-offs among various targets in the objective space, such as effect strength, outcome variance, and subgroup coverage, further complicating the subgroup discovery process. Coordinating the above factors has to follow usersâ€™ analysis requirements. Nevertheless, the identification model can hardly communicate with humans due to the lack of interpretability, which causes the <span style="color:red;">second</span> challenge. The subgroups obtained by the black-box model may hardly be interpreted by or fail to support analysis tasks. Users still need to tediously analyze and compare multiple subgroups to determine which one they prefer. In addition, without a treatment effect explanation, numerical causal conclusions alone are difficult to convince users, especially in high-stakes safety and life-critical fields.</p><div class="hint-container note"><p class="hint-container-title"><span style="color:red;">Key Information</span></p><p><strong>Challenges for analyzing causal heterogeneity</strong></p><ol><li>It is nontrivial and challenging to identify important subgroups from a large number of subgroup candidates.</li><li>the identification model can hardly communicate with humans due to the lack of interpretability</li></ol></div><p>Existing work is insufficient to address these challenges. Automated heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation methods, such as causal trees [2] and causal forests [57], mainly construct hierarchical structures for individuals in datasets and identify leaf nodes in the hierarchies as subgroups. However, not all leaf nodes can reflect a significant treatment effect, leading to less useful results. Therefore, users still need to go through tedious review and analysis to find subgroups that meet their requirements. Subgroup discovery methods [6, 22, 55] can directly optimize correlation objectives but lack attention to the more complex causal effects that require statistical inference and confounding bias correction. Some researchers use visualization to assist causal analysis, but they either focus on the representation of causal graph structure [58, 66, 59, 37], manual selection of variables to divide subgroups [29], or clustering to obtain subgroups whose meaning is difficult to describe [28]. Therefore, how to support the cooperation between human intelligence and computing power in the analysis of HTE is still underexplored.</p><p>In this work, we propose a visual analytics approach for subgroup-based causal heterogeneity exploration that supports users in effectively identifying optimal subgroups from observational data, comparing and ranking different subgroups, and verifying treatment effects. First, we propose a causal subgroup discovery model based on constrained multi-objective optimization (MOO). Subgroups are described by interpretable rules, where the rule antecedents are conjunctions containing covariates and corresponding values, and the consequents correspond to subgroup evaluation metrics, such as effects and variances. Coverage and antecedent length are used as constraints to ensure interpretability. Due to multiple objectives and constraints, the optimal Pareto front of the subgroup is learned by a heuristic searching algorithm for user analysis. Second, we design and develop an interactive prototype system, \\sysname, which incorporates intuitive visualizations of subgroups, evaluation metrics, and explanations of treatment effects, thereby facilitating usersâ€™ understanding, comparison, and verification of causal subgroups. Quantitative experiments, case studies, and expert interviews demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of the proposed model and system.
