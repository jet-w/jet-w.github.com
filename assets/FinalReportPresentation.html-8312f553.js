The word cloud is based on the attribute, which will help to identify the most important attribute for levels.</p><p>The pie chart shows the overall proportion for the levels.</p><p>The dashboard also supply the filter according to Code, Name and level to query data.

Using a set of rules to find the relationship between BIM data and specificationsï¼Œ which will help client in performing manual LOD checks more efficiently.</p><p>This data of the area loads the exported specifications. And data in here load the exported BIM data.</p><p>There are approximately 9k bim data and 7 hundred, we also supply filters for the bim data and specifications.

Such as Missing data, software-specific elements, high volume and complexity, especially we need to focus on the lack of standardization. Especially for the non-standard naming problem, such as for the floor bim data, the name sometimes is floor, sometime is flooring, and even sometimes is element floor.</p><p>For all the issues we recommend to use the standardized name for any other project.</p><h2 id="outcomes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#outcomes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Outcomes</h2><p>Each member in our team is excellent, I&#39;m very happy to work with them and we also learn a lot together, from my end I will highlight the NEGOTIATION SKILLS. We need to discuss how to handle data, to design UI and content&amp;structure for our report.<br> How about you Bhavana.</p>',19),r=[s];function h(n,d){return a(),t("div",null,r)}const c=e(o,[["render",h],["__file","FinalReportPresentation.html.vue"]]);export{c as default};
