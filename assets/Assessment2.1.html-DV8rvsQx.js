Academic integrity means a commitment by all staff and students to act with honesty, trustworthiness, fairness, respect and responsibility in all academic work.</p><p>An important part of practising integrity in academic work is showing respect for other people&#39;s ideas, and being honest about how they have contributed to your work. This means taking care not to represent the work of others as your own. Using another person&#39;s work without proper acknowledgement is considered Academic Misconduct, and the University takes this very seriously.</p><p>The University of South Australia expects students to demonstrate the highest standards of academic integrity so that its degrees are earned honestly and are trusted and valued by its students and their employers. To ensure this happens, the University has policies and procedures in place to promote academic integrity and manage academic misconduct. One of the tools used in this course to check all work submitted electronically by students for assessment is <a href="http://www.turnitin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turnitin</a>.</p><p>More information about academic integrity and what constitutes academic misconduct can be found in Section 9 of the <a href="http://i.unisa.edu.au/policies-and-procedures/codes/assessment-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assessment Policies and Procedures Manual</a> (APPM).</p><p>The <a href="https://lo.unisa.edu.au/mod/book/view.php?id=252142&amp;_gl=1*83zk20*_ga*NjM0OTk2OTI5LjE3MDU3MTUzMDM.*_ga_WC4Q6M4ZDL*MTcxNTc0Mzc0MC4zNi4xLjE3MTU3NDM5ODUuNjAuMC4w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Academic Integrity Module</a> explains in more detail how students can work with integrity at the University.</p><h2 id="feedback" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#feedback"><span>Feedback</span></a></h2><p>Your submissions will be marked and returned with feedback in about ONE week You can utilise this feedback to improve your understanding and get better prepared for the project.
