You will use a full 3-year history and all customers to have more information for the modelling. Selling any product is a risky proposition for a supermarket. If the supermarket has too much stock – unsold products will spoil and go to rubbish bin, so the supermarket will lose money. If the supermarket has not enough stock, then customers might not be able to buy, and the supermarket loses an opportunity to earn money.
