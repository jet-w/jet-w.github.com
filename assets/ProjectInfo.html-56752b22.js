This documentation will outline the <span style="color:orange;">underlying methodologies, algorithms, and techniques</span> employed in the text summarisation tool.</li><li><strong>Codebase and Integration Guidelines</strong><br> In addition to the <span style="color:orange;">prototype and documentation</span>, a well-organised and commented codebase will be provided. The codebase will contain the necessary code files, libraries, and resources required to build and run the text summarisation tool. The codebase follows best practice in software development, ensuring <span style="color:orange;">modularity, scalability, and maintainability</span>.</li><li><strong>Preparation of Scientific Publication</strong> [OPTIONAL]<br> As an additional deliverable, there is an option to prepare a scientific publication based on the findings, methodologies, and outcomes of the pilot study. The publication would aim to contribute to the academic community and industry knowledge by sharing insights, best practices, and potential advancements in the field of text summarisation across various domains, including case management and lifelong learning. This optional deliverable would involve collaborating with researchers and subject matter experts from both Genix Ventures and C3L to draft, refine, and submit the scientific publication to relevant conferences or journals. The decision to pursue this deliverable will depend on the significance of the study&#39;s outcomes and the interest of both teams in sharing their findings with the broader research community.</li></ol><h3 id="interpret" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#interpret" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Interpret</h3><ol><li><p><em><strong>Summarization Feature</strong></em>:<br> The text summarisation tool will be equipped with a powerful summarisation feature that automatically identifies and <span style="color:orange;">extracts key entities from the event timeline</span>. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, including Generative AI, the tool will condense lengthy event streams into concise summaries, highlighting the most important information for the users. This feature will enable users to quickly grasp the essence of the events and navigate through the timeline more efficiently.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Prioritization Feature</strong></em>:<br> In addition to the summarisation capability, the text summarisation tool will include a prioritization feature. This feature will <span style="color:orange;">automatically rank events</span> based on their <span style="color:orange;">importance or relevance</span> and allow users to <span style="color:orange;">provide their input on the proposed ranking</span>. This feature will assist users in focusing on the most significant events and facilitating decision-making processes.</p></li></ol><h2 id="documents" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#documents" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Documents</h2>',5),h={href:"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zb_HjJ_zArFpCArg_Mq29erP61XrzGHUQfzCGEum0Fg/edit?usp=sharing",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},u={href:"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11H75KmSGJ11tBeX1__wSTp0KOBVvOKjyMM4T1jecg5s/edit?usp=sharing",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},m={href:"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AozPQtZL6jQxSSh_4QF0TSBcoUf5uYCf9AXvGC1pR8w/edit#heading=h.o1e0j7hq7f2s",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},p={href:"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HIOeP7UBZky84f0-X7rC1G0MuiUFC-pJMeLTuiMnJMg/edit#heading=h.zbn4dizc4zcy",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function g(f,b){const t=a("ExternalLinkIcon");return r(),s("div",null,[c,e("ol",null,[e("li",null,[e("a",h,[o("Code Intergration"),n(t)])]),e("li",null,[e("a",u,[o("User Guide"),n(t)])]),e("li",null,[e("a",m,[o("Project Report"),n(t)])]),e("li",null,[e("a",p,[o("Project Report(Srecko doc)"),n(t)])])])])}const _=i(d,[["render",g],["__file","ProjectInfo.html.vue"]]);export{_ as default};
