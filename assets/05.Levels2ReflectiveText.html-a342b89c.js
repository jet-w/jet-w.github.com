Level definitions:
No-Reflection: Professionals do not indicate any significant reflective thought processes and mainly mirror the words and phrases from the question or give a general comment.
Understanding: Professionals indicate an understanding of concepts or topics from demonstrating a practical application of theory, yet lack specific details of professional or real-life experiences.
Simple Reflection: Professionals indicate an understanding of the theory in unison with examples of practical application, yet only provide a vague explanation of future actions or outcomes. They do not provide concrete examples of action or application for the future.
Critical Reflection: Besides relating the theory with examples from real-life experiences, professionals indicate what they are likely to do in the future or what they need to work on. In some cases, professionals might also reflect a change in their perspective.
