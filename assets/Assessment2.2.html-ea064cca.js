You will also <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">reflect on the analysis process</span> and <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">justify whether your outcomes can satisfy the client&#39;s information needs</span>. Write a <span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">1575-word</span> implementation report that summarises the implementation process of your project and justify the feasibility of your proposed solution to answer the business question through interpreting the analytical results.<br> For further information and detailed instructions, see the section below on Assessment instructions.</p><h2 id="aims" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aims" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Aims</h2><p>This assessment is for you to demonstrate your conceptual and technical understanding of various text and social media analytics techniques, and skills to implement them using the software packages to address a business question. Your report will be assessed on the appropriateness and accuracy of your analysis as well as on your interpretation and justification of findings and outcomes derived from the analytical results.</p><p>By completing this assessment, you would be meeting the following course objectives:<br> • CLO 3 - Apply a range of analytics techniques to text that has been derived from web or social network sources.<br> • CLO 4 - Review the use of analytics tools applied to a business problem.</p><h2 id="criteria" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#criteria" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Criteria</h2><p>You will be assessed on your ability to:<br> • Demonstrate good knowledge and skills in analysing data collected from public-facing sources.<br> • Correctly implement various text and social media analytics techniques to support a business question.<br> • Convincingly justify the analytical results with appropriate graphs and diagrams<br> • Present a report in an organised, structured, and logical manner and express ideas without any errors.</p><h2 id="instructions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#instructions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Instructions</h2><p>The implementation report is suggested to be structured in the following manner:</p><ol><li>Table of content</li><li>An introduction section (~ 1/2 page), including: <ul><li>A statement of your business question only, no additional information needed.</li><li>A framework diagram of your project implementation process.
